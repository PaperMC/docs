# Frequently Asked Questions

## Unsupported Java detected, what do I do?!

Unsupported, early-access, or internal versions of Java are often missing features, have known issues or be straight up broken. 
As such, we cannot provide support for servers running such versions.
You should install a supported version of Java as explained [here](/misc/java-install).

If you still wish to continue, knowing that you are on your own and will receive NO support, you can disable the check with a system property, as explained [here](/paper/reference/system-properties#paperignorejavaversion).
