# Teleportation

Entities can be instantaneously teleported to specific positions, synchronously and asynchronously with the
<Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Entity#teleport(org.bukkit.Location)"}>`teleport`</Javadoc> and
<Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Entity#teleportAsync(org.bukkit.Location)"}>`teleportAsync`</Javadoc> API.

:::danger[Performance]

It is strongly recommended to use the `teleportAsync` API in most cases, as it avoids doing
synchronous chunk loads, which put a lot of stress on the server's main thread - hurting
overall performance.

However, if you know that the chunk you're teleporting into is loaded, _it is recommended
to use `teleport`_ to prevent the parallelization overhead.

:::

```java
entity.teleport(location); // loads chunks synchronously and teleports the entity

entity.teleportAsync(location).thenAccept(success -> { // loads chunks asynchronously and teleports the entity
    // this code is ran when the teleport completes
    // the Future is completed on the main thread, so it is safe to use the API here

    // you should NEVER call .get()/.join() on the Future on the main thread
    // it WILL deadlock your server if the chunk is not loaded!

    if (success) {
        // the entity was teleported successfully!
    }
});
```

## Look at

The <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Player#lookAt(io.papermc.paper.math.Position,io.papermc.paper.entity.LookAnchor)"}>`lookAt`</Javadoc>
API allows you to make a player look at a certain position or entity.

```java
player.lookAt(
    position,
    LookAnchor.EYES // the player's eyes will be facing the position
);

player.lookAt(
    entity,
    LookAnchor.EYES // the player's eyes will be facing the entity
    LookAnchor.FEET // the player will be facing the entity's feet
);
```

## Teleport flags

Teleport flags offer a way to teleport entities whilst being able to customize behavior.
This allows you to do things like teleport players using relative flags and being able to retain passengers.

All available teleport flags can be found in the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.entity.TeleportFlag"}>`TeleportFlag`</Javadoc> class.

### Relative teleportation

Teleport a player relatively, preventing velocity from being reset in the X, Y and Z axes.

```java
player.teleport(
    location,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.X,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.Y,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.Z
);
```

### Retaining passengers

Teleport an entity with the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.entity.TeleportFlag$EntityState#RETAIN_PASSENGERS"}>`RETAIN_PASSENGERS`</Javadoc> flag,
allowing its passengers to be transferred with the entity.

```java
entity.teleport(location, TeleportFlag.EntityState.RETAIN_PASSENGERS);
```
