        netherrack, or end_stone based on the dimension. In contrast, 2 will
        replace both hidden-blocks and replacement-blocks with randomly

        replacing both hidden-blocks and replacement-blocks. Tile entities, such
        as chests or spawners, are not allowed on this list. Individual blocks
        may be added multiple times, increasing their chance of being placed.

        engine-mode: 3 is very similar to 2, but these blocks will be randomly

        With engine-mode: 3, the behavior is the same as engine-mode: 2, but the
