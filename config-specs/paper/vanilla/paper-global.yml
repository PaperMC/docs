packet-limiter:
  default: "<expand>"
  description: >-
    Vanilla has no packet limit by default (to disable it for all practical purposes set `all-packets.interval` to 0.000001 and `all-packets.max-packet-rate` to 999999.0,
    but it's better for security to set more specific limits). It's not feasible to reach Paper's default packet limit with a Vanilla client.
    This defaults to 500 packets per 7 seconds. If you want, you can override this setting for specific packets.
spam-limiter:
  default: "<expand>"
  description: >-
    You may want to look into this for fast crafting. Vanilla has no spam limit (set the limits to 2147483647 for this), although it's not feasible to reach Paper's default spam limit with a Vanilla client.
