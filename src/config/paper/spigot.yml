      - On other platforms, this is passed to \`sh {restart-script}\`. The
      option is interpreted as an absolute or relative path to a shell script
      (*.sh). See your operating system's documentation for more information
      (e.g. [Man Pages](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sh.1p#command_file)).
