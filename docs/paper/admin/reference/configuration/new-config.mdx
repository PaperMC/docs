<Config
    data={yaml.load(`
chunk-loading:
  autoconfig-send-distance:
    default: true
    description: Whether to use the client's view distance for the chunk send distance of the server. This will exclusively change the radius of chunks sent to the client and will not affect server-side chunk loading or ticking.

  enable-frustum-priority:
    default: false
    description: Whether to attempt to load chunks in front of the player before loading chunks to their sides or behind. Due to the client reacting poorly to receiving chunks out of order, this is disabled by default and not generally recommended for use.

  global-max-chunk-load-rate:
    default: -1.0
    description: The maximum number of chunks loaded per second for the whole server. Takes priority over player-max-chunk-load-rate.

  global-max-chunk-send-rate:
    default: -1.0
    description: The maximum number of chunks sent per second for the entire server. This may help with server-side peak bandwidth usage.

  global-max-concurrent-loads:
    default: 500.0
    description: The maximum number of chunk loads processed for the whole server one time. This will override player-max-concurrent-loads if exceeded.

  max-concurrent-sends:
    default: 2
    description: The maximum number of chunks that will be queued to send at any one time. Lower values will help alleviate server-side networking bottlenecks such as anti-xray or compression; however, it is unlikely to help users with a poor internet connection.

  min-load-radius:
    default: 2
    description: The radius of chunks around a player that are not throttled for chunk loading. The number of chunks affected is actually the configured value plus one, as this config controls the number of chunks the client will actually be able to render.

  player-max-chunk-load-rate:
    default: -1.0
    description: The maximum number of chunks loaded per second per player.

chunk-system:
  gen-parallelism:
    default: default
    description: Sets whether the server should use parallel chunk generation. The default value will be used as true. Possible options are true, on and enable to make the server use the system and false, off or disabled to disable.

  io-threads:
    default: -1
    description: Sets the number of threads to be used for read and write operations with chunks. If any value below zero is set, only one thread will be used.

  worker-threads:
    default: -1
    description: Sets the number of threads to be used for parallel chunk generation. If any value below zero is set, the server will determine the best number depending on the number of available CPU cores. This is capped at a quarter of available processors and can be less for systems with very few processors. (Note; Hyper-Threaded threads do not count).

collisions:
  enable-player-collisions:
    default: true
    description: Sets whether the server should allow players to collide with one another. This option can be broken by plugins interacting with the scoreboard. If you are having trouble with this option, try without plugins installed.
  send-full-pos-for-hard-colliding-entities:
    default: true
    description: Collisions with boats and minecarts are often subject to client/server disagreement, which may cause glitchy behaviour for players. This setting attempts to mitigate this desync by sending precise locations for entities involved in collisions. Having this enabled will use more bandwidth; however, in the majority of cases, this is a worthy tradeoff.
