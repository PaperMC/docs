import Dependency from "/src/components/Dependency.astro";
import { LATEST_ADVENTURE_PLATFORM_RELEASE } from "/src/utils/versions";

The Adventure platform implementation for Bukkit targets Paper, Spigot, and Bukkit for
Minecraft 1.7.10 through 1.21.5.

:::caution

This page documents only the *legacy* platform adapter for Bukkit. Most users should use [Paper](/paper)'s native implementation instead.
This native implementation provides more functionality, better integration with the server, and does not require the `BukkitAudiences` adapter.

Declaring the dependency:

<Dependency group="net.kyori" name="adventure-platform-bukkit" version={LATEST_ADVENTURE_PLATFORM_RELEASE} />

## Usage

You should first obtain a `BukkitAudiences` object by using `BukkitAudiences.create(plugin)`. This object is thread-safe
and can be reused from different threads if needed. From here, Bukkit `CommandSender`s and `Player`s may be converted into
`Audience`s using the appropriate methods on `BukkitAudiences`.

The audiences object should also be closed when a plugin is disabled in order to clean up resources and increase the likelihood of a successful `/reload`.

```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    private BukkitAudiences adventure;

    @NonNull
    public BukkitAudiences adventure() {
        if (this.adventure == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Tried to access Adventure when the plugin was disabled!");
        }
        return this.adventure;
    }

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        // Initialize an audiences instance for the plugin
        this.adventure = BukkitAudiences.create(this);
        // then do any other initialization
    }

    @Override
    public void onDisable() {
        if (this.adventure != null) {
            this.adventure.close();
            this.adventure = null;
        }
    }
}
```

This audience provider should be used over the serializers directly, since it will handle compatibility measures for sending messages across versions.

## Component serializers

For areas that aren't covered by the `Audience` interface, the Bukkit platform provides the `MinecraftComponentSerializer`
(available on CraftBukkit-based servers), and the `BungeeComponentSerializer` (available on Spigot and Paper servers)
to convert directly between Adventure [Components](/adventure/text) and other component types. For uses that don't integrate
directly with native types, JSON and legacy format serializers for the running server version are exposed in `BukkitComponentSerializer`.
