# Diff Viewer

The GitHub diff viewer is a great tool for most uses cases, but it has a variety of limitations,
especially when dealing with large diffs where the viewer will perform poorly or even crash. The
Patch Roulette Diff Viewer solves this problem while also providing a variety of additional features
useful for PaperMC and generally, such as special handling for second-order diffs. We have also
built a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome to streamline opening GitHub diffs in the viewer.
