# Command API

Paper's command system is built on top of Minecraft's Brigadier command system. This system is a
powerful and flexible way to define commands and arguments.

:::danger[Experimental]

Paper's command system is still experimental and may change in the future.

## Defining a Command

Commands can be easily defined within your plugin's onEnable method. This can be done like so:

```java
class YourPluginClass extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        LifecycleEventManager<Plugin> manager = this.getLifecycleManager();
        manager.registerEventHandler(LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS, event -> {
            final Commands commands = event.registrar();
            commands.register(
                Commands.literal("new-command")
                    .executes(ctx -> {
                        ctx.getSource().getSender().sendPlainMessage("some message");
                        return Command.SINGLE_SUCCESS;
                    })
                    .build(),
                "some bukkit help description string",
                List.of("an-alias")
            );
        });
    }
}
```

:::note

This uses our `LifecycleEventManager` to register the command. See the [Lifecycle Events](/dev/lifecycle) (WIP) page for more information.
