description: Libraries utilizing the Adventure API.
---

Adventure aims to provide the core libraries needed for interacting with chat components. However, with
our limited time and the sheer number of possible use cases, we can't hope to provide direct solutions for every problem.

Luckily, many of our community members have produced libraries that complement Adventure, providing additional features and integrations with other software.

## Libraries for Adventure

These are libraries focused around providing additional functionality using Adventure components.
They typically have no dependencies on a specific platform, just Adventure and potentially a library with which they integrate.
