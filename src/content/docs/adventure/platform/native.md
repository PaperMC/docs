title: Native Support
description: All native supported software.
---

Native platforms integrate Adventure directly with their platform's provided API, and bundle Adventure automatically.
This allows them to more tightly integrate Adventure with the rest of the game, and avoids users having to handle distributing
Adventure and some platform adapter themselves.

The following software provide native support for Adventure.
