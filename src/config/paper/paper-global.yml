            the item's appearance, so hiding it isn't warranted.
            In this example, lodestone trackers may reveal critical locations, but hiding the location causes the
            compass to shake around for other players. It's up to your digression whether you think this tradeoff is important.

      If a value below zero is set, the server will automatically determine the
      optimal number of threads based on the available physical CPU cores
      (**not logical cores**). For systems with 3 or fewer physical cores,
      only 1 thread will be used. In all other cases, the number of threads
