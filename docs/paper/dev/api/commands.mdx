# Command API

Paper's command system is built on top of Minecraft's Brigadier command system. This system is a
powerful and flexible way to define commands and arguments.

:::danger[Experimental]

Paper's command system is still experimental and may change in the future.

## Defining a Command

:::note

This uses our `LifecycleEventManager` to register the command. See the [Lifecycle Events](./lifecycle.mdx) page for more information.

:::

### JavaPlugin
Commands can be registered inside the <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin#onEnable()"}>onEnable</Javadoc>
method of your plugin. Commands registered here will not be available to datapack functions because
functions are loaded by the server before plugins are loaded. If you want your commands to be
available to datapacks, you should register them via the
<Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.plugin.bootstrap.PluginBootstrap#bootstrap(io.papermc.paper.plugin.bootstrap.BootstrapContext)"}>PluginBootstrap</Javadoc>.

```java
class YourPluginClass extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        LifecycleEventManager<Plugin> manager = this.getLifecycleManager();
        manager.registerEventHandler(LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS, event -> {
            final Commands commands = event.registrar();
            commands.register(
                Commands.literal("new-command")
                    .executes(ctx -> {
                        ctx.getSource().getSender().sendPlainMessage("some message");
                        return Command.SINGLE_SUCCESS;
                    })
                    .build(),
                "some bukkit help description string",
                List.of("an-alias")
            );
        });
    }
}
```

### PluginBootstrap

:::note

If any plugin on the server registers a handler for the `LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS` event, the
server will disable Bukkit's plugin reload functionality. This is a limitation with how
the plugin reload system works in conjunction with the plugin bootstrapper system. The `/reload`
functionality should never be used regardless.

:::

Commands are registered in the same way in a plugin's bootstrapper. The benefit of registering
commands here is that they will be available to datapack functions because the command registration
happens early enough.

```java
class YourPluginBootstrap implements PluginBootstrap {

    @Override
    public void bootstrap(BootstrapContext context) {
        LifecycleEventManager<BootstrapContext> manager = context.getLifecycleManager();
        // the same as JavaPlugin above
    }
}
```

### BasicCommand

Paper provides a simple <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.BasicCommand"}>BasicCommand</Javadoc>
interface which can be used to define a command in a similar way to Bukkit's `CommandExecutor`.
There are methods on the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.Commands"}>Commands</Javadoc> interface
to register such commands.

## Arguments

### Built-in Arguments

Vanilla has lots of built-in arguments that the client also supports. These can provide better
syntax and error-checking before even executing the commands. <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.argument.ArgumentTypes"}>ArgumentTypes</Javadoc>
has all the argument types available to the API.

### Custom Arguments

You can create custom arguments by implementing the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.argument.CustomArgumentType"}>CustomArgumentType</Javadoc>
interface. See the javadocs for more information on those they work.

## Lifecycle

Commands are not just registered once at the start, anytime a reload happens, either via bukkit's
reload command (which you should never use) or Minecraft's `/reload` command (which you can use),
the commands are re-registered by having the event handlers called again.
