        (hidden-blocks) with other "fake" blocks, stone (deepslate at y < 0),
        netherrack, or end_stone based on the dimension. In contrast, 2 will
        replace both hidden-blocks and replacement-blocks with randomly
        generated hidden-blocks. Similarly to engine mode 2, mode 3 will replace
        each chunk layer with a random block from the hidden-blocks list.

        of air are ignored on this list.

        With engine-mode: 2, these blocks will be randomly placed in the world,
        replacing both hidden-blocks and replacement-blocks. Tile entities, such
        as chests or spawners, are not allowed on this list. Individual blocks
        may be added multiple times, increasing their chance of being placed.

        engine-mode: 3 is very similar to 2, but these blocks will be randomly
        placed where each vertical chunk layer will take the same block from the
        list.

        randomly replaced by hidden-blocks. While tile entities are ignored in
        the hidden-blocks list, they may be added to the replacement-blocks
        list. All types of air blocks are ignored here.

        With engine-mode: 3, the behavior is the same as engine-mode: 2, but the
        replacement-blocks list is used to determine which blocks are used for
        each vertical chunk layer.

      - **eigencraft**: The Eigencraft redstone implementation by theosib.

      - **alternate-current**: The Alternate Current redstone implementation by
      Space Walker.


      **Note:** Both the Eigencraft and Alternate Current implementations change
      the behavior of redstone dust. You can read about how behavior is changed
      in each implementation's respective documention:

      - Eigencraft: No official documentation available. However,
      [theosib's comments](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777#comment-420777)
