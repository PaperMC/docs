# Welcome to the Waterfall Docs

Waterfall is the BungeeCord fork that aims to improve performance and stability.

:::danger

**The Paper team strongly recommends using [Velocity](../velocity) over Waterfall**. Waterfall is a legacy solution,
and only receives critical updates and whatever is released from upstream BungeeCord. All future
development by PaperMC is done on [Velocity](../velocity).
