# Paper Per World Config

World settings are configured on a per-world basis. The child-node _default_ is used for all worlds
that do not have their own specific settings. For more information about how per world configuration
of Paper works, see the [Per World Configuration Guide](../how-to/per-world-configuration.md). For
global config, see the [Paper Global Configuration Reference](paper-global-configuration.md)

### disable-teleportation-suffocation-check

- **default**: false
- **description**: Disables the suffocation check the server performs before teleporting a player.
- **note**: While useful to keep your players out of walls, leaving this feature on may allow
  players to teleport through solid materials by logging out in specific locations.

### max-auto-save-chunks-per-tick

- **default**: 24
- **description**: The maximum number of chunks the auto-save system will save in a single tick.

### per-player-mob-spawns

- **default**: true
- **description**: Determines whether the mob limit (in bukkit.yml) is counted per player or for the
  entire server. Enabling this setting results in roughly the same number of mobs, but with a more
  even distribution that prevents one player from using the entire mob cap and provides a more
  single-player like experience.

### baby-zombie-movement-modifier

- **default**: 0.5
- **description**: Modifies the speed that baby zombies move at, where 0.5 is 50% faster than the
  mob base speed, and -0.4 would be 40% slower.

### optimize-explosions

- **default**: false

:::caution

Alternative implementations are ultimately experimental, and as such, could be removed between
updates or even permanently if issues are found.

:::

- **default**: vanilla
- **description**: Specifies the redstone implementation that the server uses. Alternative
  implementations can greatly reduce the lag caused by redstone dust by optimizing power

    `default` allows loot tables to individually determine if the map should allow discovered
    locations in its search. All vanilla loot tables default to finding discovered locations so

### anti-xray

:::tip

Recommended configuration for both `engine-mode` `1` and `2` can be found in the
[Configuring Anti-Xray](../how-to/anti-xray.md) guide.

:::

- enabled
  - **default**: false
  - **description**: Controls the on/off state for the Anti-Xray system.
- engine-mode
  - **default**: 1
  - **description**: Sets the Anti-Xray engine mode. `1` replaces specified blocks (`hidden-blocks`)
    with other "fake" blocks, `stone` (`deepslate` at y < 0), `netherrack`, or `end_stone` based on
    the dimension. In contrast, `2` will replace both `hidden-blocks` and `replacement-blocks` with
    randomly generated `hidden-blocks`.
- max-block-height
  - **default**: 64
  - **description**: Sets the maximum height (`y` coordinate, starting from the bottom of the world)
    to which anti-xray will operate. Only integer multiples of 16 are accepted. All other values
    will be rounded down. The [Minecraft Wiki page about Ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore)
    may be helpful in determining the best value for you.
- update-radius
  - **default**: 2
  - **description**: Radius for block updates which will be sent containing real block data when the
    client interacts with a block. Only values `0`, `1`, and `2` are accepted. Values smaller than
    `0` will be rounded up to `0`, while values larger than `2` will be rounded down to `2`. `0` is
    only designed for testing purposes. Do not use it in production.
- lava-obscures
  - **default**: false
  - **description**: Whether to obfuscate blocks touching lava. Does not work well with
    non-stone-like ore textures. This is because lava, while being mostly opaque, does not cover
    blocks fully at the surface.
- use-permission
  - **default**: false
  - **description**: Whether to allow players with the `paper.antixray.bypass` permission to bypass
    anti-xray. Checking this permission is disabled by default as legacy permission plugins may
    struggle with the number of checks made. This should only be used with modern permission
    plugins.
- hidden-blocks

  - **default**: [copper_ore, deepslate_copper_ore, gold_ore, deepslate_gold_ore, iron_ore,
    deepslate_iron_ore, coal_ore, deepslate_coal_ore, lapis_ore, deepslate_lapis_ore,
    mossy_cobblestone, obsidian, chest, diamond_ore, deepslate_diamond_ore, redstone_ore,
    deepslate_redstone_ore, clay, emerald_ore, deepslate_emerald_ore, ender_chest]
  - **description**: With `engine-mode: 1`, these blocks will be replaced by `stone` (`deepslate` at
    y < 0), `netherrack`, or `end_stone`, based on the dimension. All types of air blocks are
    ignored on this list.

    With `engine-mode: 2`, these blocks will be randomly placed in the world, replacing both
    `hidden-blocks` and `replacement-blocks`. Tile entities, such as chests or spawners, are not
    allowed on this list. Individual blocks may be added multiple times, increasing their chance of
    being placed. The default block states are placed.

- replacement-blocks:

  - **default**: [stone, oak_planks, deepslate]
  - **description**: With `engine-mode: 1`, replacement blocks are not used. Changing this list will
    have no effect.

    With `engine-mode: 2`, both `replacement-blocks` and `hidden-blocks` are randomly replaced by
    `hidden-blocks.` While tile entities are ignored in the `hidden-blocks` list, they may be added
    to the `replacement-blocks` list. All types of air blocks are ignored here.

### viewdistances

:::tip

`no-tick-view-distance` has been replaced by `simulation-distance` in 1.18!

### seed-based-feature-search

- **description**: Whether the server should check if a chunk's biome (determined by world seed) can
  support the desired feature before loading it during feature searches. This dramatically reduces
  the number of chunks loaded during feature searches.
- **note**: This assumes the seed and generator have remained unchanged. If your seed or world
  generator has been changed, features will be located incorrectly.

### seed-based-feature-search-loads-chunks

- **default**: true
- **description**: When set to false, `seed-based-feature-search` will not load the target chunk.
  Instead, it will return the center of the chunk. The more precise location of the feature will be

  may lead to incorrect feature locations being returned. This will impact both the `/locate`
  command, buried treasure maps, and any other game mechanic that relies on feature searches.

        enchantments, lore or item names when observing other players.
    - hide-durability
      - **default**: false
      - **description**: Controls whether durability information is sent to other players' clients.

  Vanilla population seed stays unchanged and will not be overridden by the autofill option either.

### split-overstacked-loot

- **description**: When set to false, loot tables will not attempt to split items with a stack size
  higher than the maximum into items of smaller stack sizes. This will prevent overstacked items
  from being lost or causing a chunk to become uninhabitable (due to players getting constantly
  kicked because of oversized packets) when a shulker box is broken in survival.

### monster-spawn-max-light-level

- **default**: -1
- **description**: When set to -1, the Vanilla default will be used (=0). Set to 15 or greater to
