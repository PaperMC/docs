## Velocity

Please do not edit, recolor, rearrange, or distort the Velocity logo. Resizing the
logo and cropping out any blank space is acceptable.

The logo should not be used in a matter that suggests the Velocity project officially
endorses some product or service. For instance, you may advertise a plugin as being
compatible with Velocity, but you may not make the Velocity logo prominent in that
advertising.
