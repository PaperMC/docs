# Recipes

Recipes are a way to define a way to craft a particular item. They are defined by a plugin.

## <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.inventory.ShapedRecipe"}>`ShapedRecipe`</Javadoc>

A shaped recipe is a recipe that requires a specific pattern of items in the crafting grid to craft an item.
These are created using a patten string and a map of characters to items. The pattern strings are 3,
3 character strings that represent the rows of the crafting grid. They can be created as follows:

```java
public class TestPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        NamespacedKey key = new NamespacedKey(this, "WarriorSword");
        ItemStack item = new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND_SWORD);

        ShapedRecipe recipe = new ShapedRecipe(key, item);
        recipe.shape(" A ", "AAA", " B ");
        recipe.setIngredient('A', Material.DIAMOND);
        recipe.setIngredient('B', Material.STICK);

        getServer().addRecipe(recipe);
    }
}
```

This recipe would require a diamond sword to be crafted with a diamond in the top row, a stick in
the middle row, and a diamond in the bottom row. The diamond sword would be in the middle column of
the bottom row. This would look like this in the crafting grid:

```
 A
AAA
 B
```

:::info

You do not need to register the recipe within your plugin's `onEnable` method. You can register it at any time.

:::warning

You cannot use Air as a material in a shaped recipe, this will cause an error.

## <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.inventory.ShapelessRecipe"}>`ShapelessRecipe`</Javadoc>

A shapeless recipe is a recipe that requires a specific number of items in the crafting grid to craft an item.
These are created using a list of items. They can be created as follows:

```java
public class TestPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        NamespacedKey key = new NamespacedKey(this, "WarriorSword");
        ItemStack item = new ItemStack(Material.DIAMOND_SWORD);

        ShapelessRecipe recipe = new ShapelessRecipe(key, item);
        recipe.addIngredient(3, Material.DIAMOND);
        recipe.addIngredient(2, Material.STICK);

        getServer().addRecipe(recipe);
    }
}
```

These just mean that you need 3 diamonds and 2 sticks to craft the item, rather than the specific
orientation of the cross pattern in the crafting grid. Defined above.
