description: A guide on how to add new events to Paper.

# Events
There are several requirements for events in the Paper API.

:::note

Note that while not all existing events may follow these
guidelines, all new and modified events should adhere to them.

:::

All new events should go in the package (sub-package of) `io.papermc.paper.event`.

### Constructors

All new constructors added should be annotated with
[`@ApiStatus.Internal`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/org/jetbrains/annotations/ApiStatus.Internal.html)
to signify that they are not considered API and can change at any time without warning.

Constructors that are being replaced, if they aren't being removed, should be marked with
<Javadoc name={"java.lang.Deprecated"} project={"java"}>`@Deprecated`</Javadoc> and
<Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.annotation.DoNotUse"}>`@DoNotUse`</Javadoc>.

### Mutability
Certain API types are "mutable" which can lead to unexpected behavior within events. Mutable types like
<Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.Location"}>`Location`</Javadoc> and <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.util.Vector"}>`Vector`</Javadoc>
should therefore be cloned when returned from a "getter" in an event.

### `HandlerList`
For an event class or any subclass of it to be listened to, a <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.event.HandlerList"}>`HandlerList`</Javadoc>
field must be present with an instance and static method to retrieve it.
See the docs for <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.event.Event"}>`Event`</Javadoc> for specifics.
This field should be static and final and named `HANDLER_LIST`.

Also consider not putting a `HandlerList` on every event, just a "common parent" event so that a plugin can listen to the
parent event and capture any child events but also listen to the child event separately.

### Miscellaneous

* New parameters or method returns of type <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack"}>`ItemStack`</Javadoc>
should be [`@NotNull`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.jetbrains/annotations/latest/org/jetbrains/annotations/NotNull.html).
