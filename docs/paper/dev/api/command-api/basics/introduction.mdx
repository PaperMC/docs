# Introduction to Brigadier Commands
Paper's command system is built on top of Minecraft's Brigadier command system. This system provides a powerful and flexible way to define commands and arguments.
It offers many advantages above the previously widely used Bukkit command system:
- Less parsing or error checking required by the developer for arguments.
- Better user experience with client error checking.
- Integration with reload events, allowing the definition of commands usable in datapacks.
- Easier creation of subcommands.
