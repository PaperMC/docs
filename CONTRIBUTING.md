## Introduction

The PaperMC Docs repository contains the documentation for the PaperMC project, which is used to provide essential
information, instructions, and guidelines to our users, developers, and contributors. Your contributions play a
significant role in improving and maintaining the quality of our documentation.

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build and deploy the documentation website.
Docusaurus has [extensive documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides) detailing what is possible with it.

The bulk of Paper's documentation is written with Markdown, which is a simple markup language that is easy to learn.
Take a look at some of the existing documentation to get a feel for how it is written.

### Adding a page

To add a new page to the documentation, create a new Markdown file in the appropriate folder. For example, if you want to add
a new page to the Paper Admin docs, create a new Markdown file in the `docs/paper/admin/` folder. The file name should be in
lowercase and use hyphens to separate words. For example, `my-new-page.md`.

The page should start with a slug and title. For example:

```markdown
---
slug: /reference/paper-plugins
---

# Paper Plugins

This documentation page serves to explain all the new semantics and possible confusions that Paper plugins may introduce.
```

This will place the page at the `/paper/reference/paper-plugins` URL on the website. The slug should be unique and follow the
folder structure of the documentation. The title is the name of the page that will be displayed on the website and in the sidebar.

You must also add the page to the sidebar. In this instance we will go to the `config/sidebar.paper.ts` file and
add the file to the `items` tag for that section. You must use the file structure for that file. One example would be
`admin/reference/paper-plugins` where you omit the file extension and use slashes to denote folders. Take a look at the
existing sidebar elements to get a feel for how it is structured.

## Submitting Contributions

If you wish to contribute to the PaperMC Docs, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.

2. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.

3. Make your changes or add new documentation following the style guidelines mentioned below.

4. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.

5. Submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the Docs repository.
   Vercel will automatically deploy a preview of your changes to the PR. The link to the preview will be available in a PR comment.

6. Your PR will be reviewed, and feedback may be provided if necessary.

7. Once your contribution meets the guidelines and requirements, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Style Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability across the documentation, please adhere to the following style guidelines:

1. **American English**: All documentation should be written in American English. Please use American spellings, grammar, and punctuation.
   Take a look at [this guide](https://www.oxfordinternationalenglish.com/differences-in-british-and-american-spelling/) which outlines
   the differences between American and British English.

2. **Markdown Format**: Documentation should be written in Markdown format (.md or .mdx) for easy rendering on the website.

3. **Heading Structure**: Use `h1` (#) for the main title, `h2` (##) for section headings, and follow this pattern for subsequent subheadings.
   Capitalize the first letter of each word in a h1, however, only capitalize the first letter of the first word in h2 and h3 unless~
   it is a proper noun.

4. **Code Blocks**: When including code snippets or terminal commands, use fenced code blocks with the appropriate syntax highlighting.

5. **Admonitions**: Use admonitions to highlight important information. For example, use `:::note` for general notes, `:::tip`for tips,
   `:::caution` for warnings, and `:::danger` for critical warnings.

6. **Links and References**: When referencing external sources or linking to other pages, use descriptive anchor text and provide full URLs.

7. **Images**: Include images if necessary to illustrate concepts. Ensure the images are clear and relevant to the content.

8. **Format Code**: After you've made changes, don't forget to run the formatting script with `pnpm run format`.

9. **Keep It Concise**: Write clear and concise sentences. Avoid unnecessary jargon and explanations.

10. **Be Inclusive**: Be mindful of all readers and contributors. Use language that is inclusive and welcoming to everyone.

11. **Capitalize Vanilla**: When referring to the base game, use "Vanilla" with a capital "V".

## Automatic Doc Versioning

There are components and methods in order to embed the current Project Version into the documentation. This is done one
of a few ways:

1. `SoftwareVersion` component

   This component is used to embed the current version of the software into the documentation. An example of this would be:

   ```jsx
   <SoftwareVersion versionType={"maj-min-pat"}/> // e.g. 1.19.2
   <SoftwareVersion versionType={"maj-min"}/> // e.g. 1.19
   <SoftwareVersion versionType={"maj"}/> // e.g. 1

   // You can set the project name to be used for the versioning (defaults to paper):
   <SoftwareVersion versionType={"maj-min-pat"} project={"velocity"}/> // e.g. 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT
   ```

2. `Javadoc` component

   This component is used to embed a link to the current version of the corresponding Javadoc. An example of this would be:

   ```jsx
   <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.event.Event"}>here</Javadoc>
   // The project can also be set here, and defaults to Paper
   ```

3. `VersionFormattedCode` component

   This component is used to embed a code block with the current version of the software. An example of this would be:

   ````jsx
   <VersionFormattedCode language={"yaml"}>
   ```⠀
   name: Paper-Test-Plugin
   version: '1.0'
   main: io.papermc.testplugin.TestPlugin
   description: Paper Test Plugin
   api-version: '%%_MAJ_MIN_PAT_MC_%%'
   bootstrapper: io.papermc.testplugin.TestPluginBootstrap
   loader: io.papermc.testplugin.TestPluginLoader
   ```⠀
   </VersionFormattedCode>

   // The possible placeholders are:
   %%_MAJ_MIN_MC_%%  - Major-Minor Paper Version (E.g. 1.20)
   %%_MAJ_MIN_PAT_MC_%% - Major-Minor-Patch Paper Version (E.g. 1.20.4)
   %%_MAJ_MIN_VEL_%% - Major Velocity Version (E.g. 3.1.0)
   %%_MAJ_MIN_PAT_VEL_%% - Major-Minor-Patch Velocity Version (E.g. 3.1.1-SNAPSHOT)
   ````

When the major version of the software changes, the docs will still need to have a "snapshot" created to keep documentation
for older versions. This is done by using Docusaurus's `version` command:

```bash
pnpm docusaurus docs:version:paper "1.20"
```

## Magic Value Handling

When writing documentation, it is important to avoid using "magic values" in the documentation. This may be slightly less
obscure than in code, but it is still important to avoid using them. For example, these values may end up being used in
multiple places, and if they change, it is important to change them in all places. This is why it is important to use
our `Property` component to embed these values into the documentation. An example of this would be:

```jsx
<Property name="PAPER_JAVA_MIN" />
```

This will embed the value of the property into the documentation, and if it changes, it will be changed in all places.

These values are stored in the `config-specs/properties.json` file. If you need to add a new property, you can
add it to this file, and it will be available to use in the documentation.
