## Server Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Create a dedicated directory for your server
2. Place the downloaded Paper JAR file in this directory
3. Create a startup script or use our [Startup Script Generator](/misc/tools/start-script-gen)

### Running the Server

#### Using the Startup Script Generator
Visit our [Startup Script Generator](/misc/tools/start-script-gen) to create an optimized startup script for your system. The generator takes into account:
- Your system's available resources
- Optimal JVM arguments for Paper
- Memory allocation based on player count
- Automatic restart capabilities

#### Manual Command
For a basic startup command:
```bash
java -Xms4G -Xmx4G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:G1NewSizePercent=30 -XX:G1MaxNewSizePercent=40 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=8M -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:G1HeapWastePercent=5 -XX:G1MixedGCCountTarget=4 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=15 -XX:G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent=90 -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5 -XX:SurvivorRatio=32 -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 -jar paper.jar --nogui
```

:::note[Command Explanation]
- `-Xms4G`: Initial RAM allocation (4GB)
- `-Xmx4G`: Maximum RAM allocation (4GB)
- `--nogui`: Disables the vanilla server GUI for better performance
- JVM arguments are optimized for Paper's performance characteristics
- Adjust RAM values based on your server's needs and available system resources
:::

### First-Time Setup
1. Run the server for the first time to generate necessary files
2. Accept the EULA by editing `eula.txt` and setting `eula=true`
3. Restart the server to complete initialization
4. Review the generated configuration files

## Server Configuration

After initial setup, you'll want to configure your server:

1. Review and modify `server.properties` for basic server settings:
   - Server name and description
   - Player limits
   - View distance
   - Difficulty settings
   - Game mode
   - PvP settings

2. Configure Paper-specific settings in `paper.yml`:
   - Performance optimizations
   - Anti-cheat settings
   - Chunk loading behavior
   - Entity tracking ranges
   - Redstone optimizations

3. Set up world-specific configurations in `bukkit.yml` and `spigot.yml`:
   - World generation settings
   - Mob spawning rules
   - Item despawn times
   - Experience settings

4. For detailed configuration guides, see:
   - [Global Configuration](/paper/reference/global-configuration)
   - [Per World Configuration](/paper/reference/world-configuration)
   - [Performance Tuning Guide](/paper/admin/performance)

## Updating Your Server

Paper makes updating simple and safe:
1. Download the new version from the downloads page
2. Create a backup of your server files
3. Replace the old JAR file with the new one
4. Restart your server
5. Monitor the server logs for any issues

For detailed update instructions, see our [Update Tutorial](/paper/updating).

## Migration Guide

### From Vanilla
Paper automatically handles the conversion of vanilla world saves, including:
- Separation of dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End)
- Conversion of world data to Paper's optimized format
- Preservation of all existing world data
- Automatic conversion of player data

### From CraftBukkit/Spigot
Paper is a direct drop-in replacement:
- No world conversion needed
- All plugins and configurations remain compatible
- Improved performance out of the box
- Enhanced security features

## Next Steps

To optimize your server and unlock Paper's full potential:
1. Review our [Next Steps Guide](/paper/next-steps)
2. Configure performance optimizations
3. Set up essential plugins
4. Implement proper backup solutions
5. Configure security settings
6. Set up monitoring and logging
7. Configure automatic updates
8. Implement proper player management

:::tip[Pro Tip]
