description: Using Adventure with ViaVersion.
---

On supported platforms (Sponge 7 and Bukkit), Adventure is able to enhance its functionality
by using the [ViaVersion](https://hangar.papermc.io/ViaVersion/ViaVersion) API
to send packets directly to the client. This allows, for instance, for a plugin on a Minecraft
1.7 server to send RGB chat messages and titles to clients on newer versions of Minecraft.

If you include the Sponge or Bukkit platforms, no further action is required: ViaVersion will
be detected and support for it will be enabled.
