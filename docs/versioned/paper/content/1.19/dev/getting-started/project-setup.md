# Paper Project Setup

As the Paper team primarily uses [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), this guide will be focused on that IDE. 
However, the steps below should apply to other IDEs as well, with some minor changes.

The Paper team uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as its build system, and its tools are implemented for Gradle. 
Most of the code below can be altered to work with other build systems, such as Maven, but this guide will only cover Gradle.

Follow the guide [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/migrating_from_maven.html) to learn how to migrate from Maven to Gradle.

### Creating a new project

Open your IDE and select the option to create a new project. 
In Intellij, you will get the option to select the type of project you want to create - select `New Project`.
Select `Gradle - Kotlin DSL` and click `Create`.

You will land into the `build.gradle.kts` file where you can add your dependencies.

### Adding Paper as a dependency

To add Paper as a dependency, you will need to add the Paper repository to your `build.gradle.kts` file as well as the dependency itself.

```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly("io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.19.4-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}

java {
    toolchain.languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(17))
}
```

### Setting up the `src` directory

:::note

If your IDE creates a `src` directory automatically, you can skip this step.

:::

To set up the `src` directory, you will need to create a new directory called `src` and then create a new directory called `main` inside of it.
Inside of `main`, create two new directories called `java` and `resources`.

It should look like this:

```
...
example-plugin
├── build.gradle.kts
├── settings.gradle.kts
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        └── resources
...
```

### Setting up the `java` directory

You will place your Java source files in the `java` directory. You first need to create some packages to organize your code.
For this example, we will create three packages called `io.papermc.testplugin` and then create a class called `ExamplePlugin` inside of it.

```
...
example-plugin
├── build.gradle.kts
├── settings.gradle.kts
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   └── io
        │       └── papermc
        │           └── testplugin
        │               └── ExamplePlugin.java
        └── resources
...
```

### Packages

You can see here that the `ExamplePlugin` class is inside the `io.papermc.testplugin` package. 
A package is a way to organize your code - essentially, it's a folder. Java packages are used to group related classes. 
Oracle has a guide on [packages](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/packages.html) if you want to learn more.

When [naming](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html) your packages, you should use your domain name in reverse order. For example, if your domain name is `papermc.io`,
your package name should be `io.papermc`. If you do not have a domain name, you could use something like your GitHub username.
If you were Linus Torvalds, your package would be `io.github.torvalds`.

This is then followed by the name of your project. 
For example, if your project was called `ExamplePlugin`, your package would be `io.github.torvalds.exampleplugin`. 
This allows for a unique package name for every plugin.

### The _main_ class

The main class is the entry point to your plugin and will be the only class that extends `JavaPlugin` in your plugin. 
This is an example of what your `ExamplePlugin` class could look like:

```java
package io.papermc.testplugin;

import net.kyori.adventure.text.Component;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;
import org.bukkit.event.player.PlayerJoinEvent;
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin implements Listener {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        Bukkit.getPluginManager().registerEvents(this, this);
    }

    @EventHandler
    public void onPlayerJoin(PlayerJoinEvent event) {
        event.getPlayer().sendMessage(Component.text("Hello, " + event.getPlayer().getName() + "!"));
    }

}
```

### Setting up the `resources`

The `resources` directory is where you will place your plugin's `plugin.yml` file. See the [Plugin YML](plugin-yml) page for more information.

### Conclusion

You should now have a project set up with Paper as a dependency.
All you have left to do now is to compile your plugin and run it on a Paper server.

:::note

If you want to streamline the process of testing a plugin, you can use the [Run-Paper](https://github.com/jpenilla/run-paper) Gradle task.
It will automatically download a Paper server and run it for you.

:::info
    
If you are using IntelliJ, you can use the Gradle GUI `Build` menu to compile your plugin - found on the top right of your IDE.
The output jar of your plugin will be in the `build/libs` directory.
