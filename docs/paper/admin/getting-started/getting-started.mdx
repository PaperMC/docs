# Getting Started

## Requirements

:::tip

Paper requires at least **Java <Property name="PAPER_JAVA_MIN" />** to run, which [is easy to download and install](/misc/java-install).

:::

| Paper Version  | Recommended Java Version                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1.8 to 1.11    | Java 8                                  |
| 1.12 to 1.16.4 | Java 11                                 |
| 1.16.5         | Java 16                                 |
| 1.17.1-1.18.1+ | Java <Property name="PAPER_JAVA_MIN" /> |

## Downloading Paper

Paper provides runnable server JARs directly from our
[website's downloads page](https://papermc.io/downloads).

Click on the build number to download a file.

## Running the server

To run the server you will need to either create a startup script
or run a command in your terminal.

You can generate a startup script using our [Startup Script Generator](/misc/tools/start-script-gen).
You can also obtain the optimized terminal command to run the server there.

If you're just looking for a short command:
```bash
java -Xms4G -Xmx4G -jar paper.jar --nogui
```
Ensure you navigated your terminal to the directory of your server
and that you have replaced `paper.jar` with the name of the JAR you have downloaded.

The amount of RAM can be set by changing the numbers in the `Xmx` and `Xms` arguments.
`--nogui` disables Vanilla's GUI, so you don't get double interfaces when using the command line.

To configure your server, see the [Global Configuration](../reference/configuration/global-configuration.mdx) and
[Per World Configuration](../reference/configuration/world-configuration.mdx) pages.

## Updating the server

Updating Paper is simple! See our [Update Tutorial](../how-to/update.md) for more information.

## Migrating to Paper

### From Vanilla

Migrating from Vanilla is easy, but there are some differences, namely in world saves. Paper (and
CraftBukkit and Spigot) separate out each dimension of a world (nether, the end, etc.) into separate
world folders.

Paper will handle this conversion for you automatically. No additional consideration is required.

### From CraftBukkit or Spigot

Paper is a drop in replacement for both CraftBukkit and Spigot, you don't need to make any changes.

## Next steps

Take a look at our [Next Steps](/paper/next-steps) guide to get your server up and running with the best performance and
features.
