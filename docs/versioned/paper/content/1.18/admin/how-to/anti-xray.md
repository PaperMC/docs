# Configuring Anti-Xray

> Originally written and maintained by [stonar96](https://github.com/stonar96).

Paper includes an obfuscation-based Anti-Xray with two modes, configurable per world in paper.yml.

:::info[Per World Configuration]

If you aren't already familiar with per world configuration, please take a moment to familiarize
yourself with the [Per World Configuration Guide](per-world-configuration.md).

:::

This guide is a step-by-step walk-through for configuring Anti-Xray. For reference documentation,
refer to the Anti-Xray section of the
[Per-World Configuration Reference](../reference/paper-per-world-configuration.md#anti-xray).

Anti-Xray has two different modes. `engine-mode: 1` replaces specified blocks (`hidden-blocks`) with
other "fake" blocks, `stone` (`deepslate` at y < 0), `netherrack`, or `end_stone` based on the
dimension. In contrast, `engine-mode: 2` will replace both `hidden-blocks` and `replacement-blocks`
with randomly generated `hidden-blocks`.

The following images[^1] show how each mode will look for a player using Xray with the recommended
configuration in both the overworld and nether.

Especially on the client side, `engine-mode: 1` is much less computationally intensive, while
`engine-mode: 2` may better prevent Xray. With `engine-mode: 1`, only ores that are entirely covered
by solid blocks will be hidden. Ores exposed to air in caves or water from a lake will not be
hidden. With `engine-mode: 2`, fake ores obstruct the view of real blocks. If `air` is added to
`hidden-blocks`, `engine-mode: 2` will effectively hide all ores, even those exposed to air.

:::caution[Anti-Xray Bypasses]

**Range Extension**: While Anti-Xray alone will prevent the majority of users from Xraying on your
server, it is not by any means infallible. Because of how Anti-Xray is (and has to be) implemented,
it is possible to, on a default server, extend the range of real ores you can see by a not
insignificant amount. This can be mitigated by any competent anti-cheat plugin; however, this is not
included out of the box.

**Seed Reversing**: Another attack vector is the deterministic nature of Minecraft's world
generation. If the client is able to obtain the world seed, it is able to know the real location of
every generated ore, completely bypassing Anti-Xray. This can be partially worked around by making
it harder for the client to reverse the world seed with the
[`feature-seeds` configuration](../reference/paper-per-world-configuration.md#feature-seeds), in
conjunction with the structure seed options in `spigot.yml`. Note that this is not a complete
solution, and it may still be possible for a client to obtain the server's world seed. Using a
different seed for each world may also be beneficial.

**Ores Exposed to Air**: In both `engine-mode: 1` and `engine-mode: 2`, it is possible for a client
to view ores that are exposed to air. This can be mitigated in `engine-mode: 2` by adding `air` to
the `hidden-blocks` list. However, doing this may cause client performance issues (FPS drops) for
some players.

## Recommended Configuration

The recommended configuration for both `engine-mode: 1` and `engine-mode: 2` is as follows:

### `engine-mode: 1`

<details>
  <summary>Overworld Configuration</summary>

Replace the existing `anti-xray` block in `paper.yml` (under `world-settings.default`) with the
following:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml title="paper.yml"
    anti-xray:
      enabled: true
      engine-mode: 1
      # As of 1.18 some ores are generated much higher.
      # Please adjust the max-block-height setting at your own discretion.
      # https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore might be helpful.
      max-block-height: 64
      update-radius: 2
      lava-obscures: false
      use-permission: false
      hidden-blocks:
      # There's no chance to hide dungeon chests as they are entirely surrounded by air, but buried treasures will be hidden.
      - chest
      - coal_ore
      - deepslate_coal_ore

the world names if your worlds are named differently!
