# Art Assets

This page provides the official PaperMC and Velocity logomarks and the terms under which you may use them.

:::warning

The logomarks are subject to their own separate licensing terms and do not inherit any from the
projects they represent.

:::

## PaperMC

You may:

- Use the PaperMC logomark to represent the project in blogposts and other places in order to bring
  attention to the project.
- Use the PaperMC logomark to represent Paper-Server in downloads, server selectors, and similar
  places.
- Crop out extra transparent canvas space behind the PaperMC logomark, so it fits better next to
  other content.

You may not:

- Alter any of the colors used in the PaperMC logomark.
- Change the dimensions of the PaperMC logomark.
- Create modified versions of the PaperMC logomark or derivative works of it.
- Add your own project images or branding to the PaperMC logomark.
- Claim the logomark as your own work or use it as a representation of your own projects.
- Sell the PaperMC logomark on its own or as part of other products without explicit permission.
- Alter the transparency of any elements within the PaperMC logomark.

## Velocity

Please do not edit, recolor, rearrange, or distort the Velocity logo. Resizing the
logo and cropping out any blank space is acceptable.

The logo should not be used in a matter that suggests the Velocity project officially
endorses some product or service. For instance, you may advertise a plugin as being
compatible with Velocity, but you may not make the Velocity logo prominent in that
advertising.

Variants of the Velocity logomark may be found [here](https://github.com/VelocityPowered/Branding).
