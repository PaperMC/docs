Adventure provides a platform for SpongeAPI 7 for *Minecraft: Java Edition* 1.12.

:::caution[Warning]

For SpongeAPI 8 and up (targeting *Minecraft: Java Edition* 1.16.4), Adventure is the native text library, so no platform adapter is needed.
Sponge's API interfaces directly extend Adventure's rather than needing a `SpongeAudiences` adapter.

:::

Declaring the dependency:

<Dependency group="net.kyori" name="adventure-platform-spongeapi" version={LATEST_ADVENTURE_PLATFORM_RELEASE} />

## Usage

The SpongeAPI platform can either be created through Guice dependency injection, or created directly. We recommend using injection, since less boilerplate is required.

An example plugin is fairly straightforward:

```java
@Plugin(/* [...] */)
public class MyPlugin {
    private final SpongeAudiences adventure;

    @Inject
    MyPlugin(final SpongeAudiences adventure) {
        this.adventure = adventure;
    }

    @NonNull
    public SpongeAudiences adventure() {
        return this.adventure;
    }
}
```

This sets up a `SpongeAudiences` instance that can provide audiences for players, or any `MessageReceiver`.
