The datapack discovery API is currently experimental and may change in the future.

:::

The lifecycle API grants developers much more direct access to modifying some of the core parts of the server.
One such core aspect are **datapacks**. No more asking users to download your datapack alongside the plugin — you
can now include the datapack in your plugin JAR and load it yourself!

:::note

This feature requires you to have a basic understanding of the [Lifecycle API](/paper/dev/lifecycle),
the datapack format (which you can look up in the [Minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack)), and
requires you to use a [`paper-plugin.yml` plugin](/paper/dev/getting-started/paper-plugins).

## The datapack discovery lifecycle event
The [`LifecycleEvents.DATAPACK_DISCOVERY`](jd:paper:io.papermc.paper.plugin.lifecycle.event.types.LifecycleEvents#DATAPACK_DISCOVERY) lifecycle
event allows developers to add, check for, and even remove datapacks which are about to be loaded by the server.

:::tip

The following code examples are assumed to be executed inside a `PluginBootstrap`'s `bootstrap(BootstrapContext context)` method.
They are also assumed to already be inside an event handler, resulting in a structure like this:

```java title="CustomPluginBootstrap.java" showLineNumbers
@NullMarked
public class CustomPluginBootstrap implements PluginBootstrap {

    @Override
    public void bootstrap(BootstrapContext context) {
        context.getLifecycleManager().registerEventHandler(LifecycleEvents.DATAPACK_DISCOVERY.newHandler(
            event -> {
                // All code is contained here.
            }
        ));
    }
}
```

:::

### Retrieving all currently discovered datapacks
For the sake of simplicity, let's start with the most basic operation: Retrieving discovered data packs.
For this, we can use the following simple code:

```java showLineNumbers startLineNumber=8
context.getLogger().info("The following datapacks were found: {}",
    String.join(", ", event.registrar().getDiscoveredPacks().keySet())
);
```

This might yield the following log output:

```
[00:26:12 INFO]: [PaperDocsTestProject] The following datapacks were found: file/bukkit, minecart_improvements, paper, redstone_experiments, trade_rebalance, vanilla
```

This resulted in a few more datapacks than one might expect. Primarily, at the time of writing, the experimental `minecart_improvements`, `redstone_experiments`,
and `trade_rebalance` datapacks. The datapack discovery does not care about whether a datapack should be enabled or not. It simply **looks for** datapacks that
the server *could* enable.

### Removing discovered datapacks
You can very easily prevent datapacks from being discovered by calling [`DatapackRegistrar#removeDiscoveredPack(String name)`](jd:paper:io.papermc.paper.datapack.DatapackRegistrar#removeDiscoveredPack(java.lang.String))
on the datapack's name.

To remove the above-mentioned, experimental datapacks, you could the following code:

```java showLineNumbers startLineNumber=8
// The names of the datapacks we want to remove.
final Set<String> datapacksToRemove = Set.of("minecart_improvements", "redstone_experiments", "trade_rebalance");

datapacksToRemove.forEach(
    // Iterate through every datapack and remove it from the discovered packs.
    datapack -> event.registrar().removeDiscoveredPack(datapack)
);

// The logging line from before.
context.getLogger().info("The following datapacks were found: {}",
    String.join(", ", event.registrar().getDiscoveredPacks().keySet())
);
```

This would, as expected, remove the entries from being logged (and thus discovered):
```
[00:35:39 INFO]: [PaperDocsTestProject] The following datapacks were found: file/bukkit, paper, vanilla
```

## Registering custom datapacks
The main use case of the datapack register lifecycle event is the adding of plugin included datapacks. And Paper makes this pretty simple:
You have to include your datapack in the plugin's JAR file, as already mentioned. This **does not** mean including the datapack zip.
This means including the **source files**, which makes it very convenient to work with in a dev environment.

:::tip

This section assumes that you already have a working datapack. If you do not have one, but still want to play around with datapack inclusion in your plugin,
you can check out [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net) for their data packs.

:::

### Including the datapack in your plugin
Before you can let the server know about your datapack, you must first include it. For this, you can just add it to your **plugins src/main/resources** folder.
The datapack should have at least one extra folder (so don't dump all the contents into the `resources` root). For this example, it will be located under
**resources/custom_datapack**, but you can rename this second folder to any name you want to. If you have done everything correctly, you should have a folder structure,
which looks similar to this:

<FileTree>
  - src/main/resources
        - custom_datapack
          - pack.mcmeta
          - data/
</FileTree>

Build your plugin and verify that there is a `custom_datapack` folder in the root of your plugin's JAR file.

### Discovering the datapack
To discover the datapack, you must call the [`DatapackRegistrar#discoverPack(URI uri, String id)`](jd:paper:io.papermc.paper.datapack.DatapackRegistrar#discoverPack(java.net.URI,java.lang.String))
method. The uri should point to **your datapack's folder in your JAR**. This can be achieved simply by calling
`getClass().getResource("/custom_datapack").toURI()`. **The preceding slash is very important**. The id can be set to
whatever you want to identify your datapack with. The final name of the loaded pack will be `<YourPluginName>/<id>`.

Code example:

```java showLineNumbers startLineNumber=8
try {
    // Retrieve the URI of the datapack folder.
    URI uri = this.getClass().getResource("/custom_datapack").toURI();
    // Discover the pack. The ID is set to "provided", which indicates to
    // a server owner that your plugin includes this data pack.
    event.registrar().discoverPack(uri, "provided");
} catch (URISyntaxException | IOException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```

### Verifying that the datapack loaded correctly
You can verify that a datapack loaded simply by executing the command `/datapack list enabled`.

Alternatively, you can check for the loaded status of your datapack during normal execution
of your plugin. For example, a simple check inside your plugin's `onLoad` method might look like this:

```java title="CustomJavaPlugin.java" showLineNumbers
public final class CustomJavaPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onLoad() {
        Datapack pack = this.getServer().getDatapackManager().getPack(getPluginMeta().getName() + "/provided");
        if (pack != null) {
            if (pack.isEnabled()) {
                this.getLogger().info("The datapack loaded successfully!");
            } else {
                this.getLogger().warn("The datapack failed to load.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If everything has gone correctly, the console should contain output similar to this:
```
[01:10:12 INFO]: [PaperDocsTestProject] Loading server plugin PaperDocsTestProject v1.0-DEV
[01:10:12 INFO]: [PaperDocsTestProject] The datapack loaded successfully!
```
