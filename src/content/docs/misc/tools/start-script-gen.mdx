  <summary>What flags do I choose?</summary>
  If you're running on a modern JVM, i.e. 17, 21 or higher, try with no flags first.
  Modern JVMs are very good at handling various applications with default GC settings.

  If you have GC problems or are running an older version of Minecraft/an older version of Java,
  try [Aikar's flags](/paper/aikars-flags), which are optimized specifically for Minecraft.

  If you're generating a script for starting [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), choose "Velocity".
