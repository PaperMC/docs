# Diff Viewer

Multi-file rich diff viewer with support for GitHub commits, PRs, and comparisons, as well as
diff and patch files.
The GitHub diff viewer is a great tool for most uses cases, but it has a variety of limitations,
especially when dealing with large diffs where the viewer will perform poorly or even crash. The
Patch Roulette diff viewer aims to solve this problem while also providing a variety of additional
features useful for PaperMC and generally, such as special handling for second-order diffs. We have
also built a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome to streamline opening GitHub diffs in the
viewer.
