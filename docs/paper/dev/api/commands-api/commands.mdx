# Commands

Paper's command system is built on top of Minecraft's Brigadier command system. This system is a
powerful and flexible way to define commands and arguments.

:::danger[Experimental]

Paper's command system is still experimental and may change in the future.

:::

## Defining commands

:::note

This uses the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.plugin.lifecycle.event.LifecycleEventManager"}>LifecycleEventManager</Javadoc>
to register the command. See the [Lifecycle Events](./lifecycle.mdx) page for more information.

:::

### JavaPlugin

Commands can be registered inside the <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin#onEnable()"}>onEnable</Javadoc>
method of the plugin. Commands registered here will not be available to datapack functions because
functions are loaded by the server before plugins are loaded. To make commands available to
datapacks, register them via the [PluginBootstrap](#pluginbootstrap).

```java
public class YourPluginClass extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void onEnable() {
        LifecycleEventManager<Plugin> manager = this.getLifecycleManager();
        manager.registerEventHandler(LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS, event -> {
            final Commands commands = event.registrar();
            commands.register(
                Commands.literal("new-command")
                    .executes(ctx -> {
                        ctx.getSource().getSender().sendPlainMessage("some message");
                        return Command.SINGLE_SUCCESS;
                    })
                    .build(),
                "some bukkit help description string",
                List.of("an-alias")
            );
        });
    }
}
```

### PluginBootstrap

:::note

If any plugin on the server registers a handler for the `LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS` event, the
server will disable Bukkit's plugin reload functionality. This is a limitation with how
the plugin reload system works in conjunction with the plugin bootstrapper system. The `/reload`
command should never be used regardless.

:::

Commands are registered in the same way in a plugin's
<Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.plugin.bootstrap.PluginBootstrap#bootstrap(io.papermc.paper.plugin.bootstrap.BootstrapContext)"}>bootstrapper</Javadoc>.
The benefit of registering commands here is that they will be available to datapack functions
because the command registration happens early enough.

```java
public class YourPluginBootstrap implements PluginBootstrap {

    @Override
    public void bootstrap(BootstrapContext context) {
        LifecycleEventManager<BootstrapContext> manager = context.getLifecycleManager();
        // Same as for JavaPlugin
    }
}
```

### BasicCommand

Paper provides a simple <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.BasicCommand"}>BasicCommand</Javadoc>
interface which can be used to define a command in a similar way to Bukkit's `CommandExecutor`.
There are methods on the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.command.brigadier.Commands"}>Commands</Javadoc> interface
to register such commands.

Example registration and implementation of a BasicCommand:

```java
LifecycleEventManager<BootstrapContext> manager = context.getLifecycleManager();
manager.registerEventHandler(LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS, event -> {
    final Commands commands = event.registrar();
    commands.register("fun", "some help description string", new FunCommand());
});
```

```java
class FunCommand implements BasicCommand {

    @Override
    public void execute(@NotNull CommandSourceStack stack, @NotNull String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 1 && args[0].equalsIgnoreCase("start")) {
            stack.getSender().sendRichMessage("<rainbow>Fun activated!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle

Commands are not just registered once at the start, but anytime a reload happens. This can be
either via Bukkit's reload command (which should never be used and may not always be available) or
Minecraft's `/reload` command (which can be used), the commands are re-registered by having the
event handlers called again.
