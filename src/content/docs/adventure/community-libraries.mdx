description: Libraries utilizing the Adventure API.
---

Adventure aims to provide the core libraries needed for interacting with chat components.
However, with the limited resources and time of the Adventure team and the sheer number of possible use cases, we can't hope to provide direct solutions for every problem.

Luckily, many of our community members have produced libraries that complement Adventure, providing additional features and integrations with other software.

:::note

This list of libraries is provided for reference only.
The Adventure team does not endorse any specific library, and cannot provide any information or support beyond the provided links.

If you have a library that you'd like included, please open a pull request on the [PaperMC/docs](https://github.com/PaperMC/docs) repository.

## Serializers

These are libraries focused around providing additional serialization formats for chat components.
They typically have no dependencies on a specific platform, just Adventure and potentially a library with which they integrate.

## Additional user interface libraries

These are libraries with a focus on something other than chat components, that use Adventure in their API.
They provide support for using Adventure in user interface elements not supported by the core Adventure libraries.
This includes, but is not limited to, commands, scoreboards, and inventories.
These libraries will often depend on one or more specific platforms to support their functionality.
