# Vanilla-like Experience

import React from 'react';
import ConfigDocBlock from '@site/src/components/config/ConfigDocBlock';
import VanillaWorldDefaults from '!!raw-loader!@site/config-specs/paper/vanilla/paper-world-defaults.yml'
import VanillaGlobalDefaults from '!!raw-loader!@site/config-specs/paper/vanilla/paper-global.yml'
import SpigotChanges from '!!raw-loader!@site/config-specs/paper/vanilla/spigot.yml'

Due to the way the Bukkit API is implemented in Paper, the gameplay experience between Vanilla and Paper can have inconsistencies.
This can be furthered by efforts to fix bugs present in Vanilla Minecraft.
Whilst many people may not notice the inconsistencies, there are situations where they become problematic.
One example is that technical players may struggle getting their machines to work like they should.
This page aims to provide a starting point for players who want to get as close to Vanilla as possible.

:::info

This page is inspired by [Earthcomputer's collection](https://gist.github.com/Earthcomputer/2296da33b8cc91dba81b48103c0e1fe3) of Vanilla breaking changes.

:::warning

This guide will only help you to get as close to Vanilla as possible.
Unfortunately, it currently is not possible to get a 100% Vanilla experience in Paper.

## paper-world-defaults.yml
<ConfigDocBlock data={VanillaWorldDefaults}/>

## paper-global.yml
<ConfigDocBlock data={VanillaGlobalDefaults}/>

## spigot.yml
<ConfigDocBlock data={SpigotChanges}/>

## Further considerations

* `settings.timeout-time` in `spigot.yml` mirrors the watchdog setting in the `server.properties` file. Keep in mind that the `spigot.yml` setting is in seconds while the default setting is in milliseconds.
* `watchdog` in `paper-global.yml` controls the watchdog early warning. While this is only a warning, you might want to disable it as it can get annoying.
