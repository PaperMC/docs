  disable-noteblock-updates:
    default: "false"
    description: >-
      Whether to disable any form of block updates for note blocks on the
      server. Disabling block updates leads to note blocks no longer updating
      their block state, allowing for technically invalid note blocks to remain
      in the world, which might be useful for mapmakers.
  disable-tripwire-updates:
    default: "false"
    description: >-
      Whether to disable any form of block updates for tripwires on the server.
      Disabling block updates leads to tripwires no longer updating their block
      state, allowing for technically invalid tripwires to remain in the world,
      which might be useful for mapmakers.

    description: >-
      Specifies the maximum amount of concurrent chunk generations that an

  player-max-chunk-load-rate:
    default: "100"
    description: >-
      The maximum rate at which chunks will load for any individual player. Note
      that this setting also affects chunk generations, since a chunk load is
      always first issued to test if a chunk is already generated. Set to -1 to
      disable this limit.
  player-max-chunk-send-rate:

      make the server use the system and false, off or disabled to disable.
  io-threads:
    default: "-1"
    description: >-
      Sets the number of threads to be used for read and write operations with
      chunks. If any value below zero is set, only one thread will be used.
  worker-threads:
    default: "-1"
    description: >-
      Sets the number of threads to be used for parallel chunk generation. If
      any value below zero is set, the server will determine the best number
      depending on the number of available CPU cores. This is capped at a
      quarter of available processors and can be less for systems with very few
      processors. _(Note: Hyper-Threaded threads **do not** count)_.
collisions:

    description: >-
      Collisions with boats and minecarts are often subject to client/server
      disagreement, which may cause glitchy behavior for players. This setting
      attempts to mitigate this desync by sending precise locations for entities
      involved in collisions. Having this enabled will use more bandwidth;
      however, in the majority of cases, this is a worthy tradeoff
