import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import AdventureDependency from "/src/components/adventure/AdventureDependency.astro";

To use Adventure in your project, you will need to add the following dependency (and repository if using Gradle):

<AdventureDependency artifact="adventure-api" project="api"/>

Some platforms already use Adventure natively.
In this case, you will not need to add Adventure as a dependency.
To view the list of platforms that include Adventure, see [Native Support](/adventure/platform/native).

To use Adventure with other platforms, you may wish to look at the platform-specific adapters.
A list of platforms with supported adapters can be found at [Platforms](/adventure/platform).

## Using snapshot builds

To use snapshot builds, you will need to add the following repository:

<Tabs syncKey="build-system">
<TabItem label="Maven">
  ```xml
  <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>sonatype-oss-snapshots1</id>
        <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
      </repository>
  </repositories>
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Gradle (Groovy)">
  ```groovy
  repositories {
    maven {
        name = "sonatype-oss-snapshots1"
        url = "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
    }
  }
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Gradle (Kotlin)">
  ```kotlin
  repositories {
    maven(url = "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") {
        name = "sonatype-oss-snapshots"
    }
  }
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
