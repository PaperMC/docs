import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

import Dependency from "/src/components/Dependency.astro";
import { LATEST_ADVENTURE_API_RELEASE } from "/src/utils/versions";

To use Adventure in your project, you will need to add the following dependency (and repository if using Gradle):

Declaring the dependency:

<Dependency group="net.kyori" name="adventure-api" version={LATEST_ADVENTURE_API_RELEASE} />

Need development/snapshot builds? [Using Snapshot Builds](#using-snapshot-builds)

Some platforms already use Adventure natively.
In this case, you will not need to add Adventure as a dependency.
To view the list of platforms that include Adventure, see [Native Support](/adventure/platform/native).

To use Adventure with other platforms, you may wish to look at the platform-specific adapters.
A list of platforms with supported adapters can be found at [Platforms](/adventure/platform).

## Using snapshot builds

To use snapshot builds, you will need to add the following repository:

<Tabs syncKey="build-system">
  <TabItem label="Gradle (Kotlin)">
    ```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
    repositories {
      maven(url = "https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/") {
        name = "sonatype-oss-snapshots"
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gradle (Groovy)">
    ```groovy title="build.gradle"
    repositories {
      maven {
        name = 'sonatype-oss-snapshots1'
        url = 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
      }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Maven">
    ```xml title="pom.xml"
    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>sonatype-oss-snapshots1</id>
        <url>https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
