:::danger[Do not allocate all of your available memory on a shared host!]

When setting the `Xms` and `Xmx` values, if your host says you have 8GB of memory, **do not use 8GB**!

Minecraft (and Java) needs additional memory on top of that `Xmx` parameter. It is recommended to
**reduce your `Xmx` and `Xms` by about 1000-1500MB** to avoid running out of memory or `OOMKiller` killing
your server. This also leaves room for the operating system to use memory too.

Do you have 8GB of memory? Use 6500MB for safety.
_But you may also ask your host if they will cover this overhead for you and
give you 9500M instead. Some hosts will! Just ask._

:::

## Recommended memory

**We recommend using at least 6-10GB**, no matter how few players! If you can't afford 10GB of
memory, give as much as you can, but ensure you leave the operating system some memory too. G1GC
operates better with more memory.

However, more memory does not mean better performance above a certain point. Eventually you will hit
a point of diminishing returns. Going out and getting 32GB of RAM for a server will only waste your
money with minimal returns.

## Java GC logging

Are you having old gen issues with these flags? Add the following flags based on your Java version
to enable GC logging:

**Java 8-10**

```bash
-Xloggc:gc.log -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
-XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=5 -XX:GCLogFileSize=1M
```

**Java 11+**

```bash
-Xlog:gc*:logs/gc.log:time,uptime:filecount=5,filesize=1M
```

GC logging does not hurt your performance and can be left on at all times. The files will not take
up much space (5MB)

## Technical explanation of the flags

1.  **-Xms matching -Xmx - why:** You should never run your server with the case that `Xmx` can run
    the system completely out of memory. Your server should always be expected to use the entire
    `Xmx`! You should then ensure the OS has extra memory on top of that `Xmx` for non-Minecraft/OS level
    things. Therefore, you should never run Minecraft with `Xmx` settings you can't support if Java uses it
    all. Now, that means **if `Xms` is lower than `Xmx` you have unused memory**! Unused memory is
    wasted memory. G1 operates better with the more memory it's given. G1 adaptively chooses how
    much memory to give to each region to optimize pause time. If you have more memory than it needs
    to reach an optimal pause time, G1 will simply push that extra into the old generation, and it
    will not hurt you. The fundamental idea of improving GC behavior is to ensure short-lived objects
    die young and never get promoted. With the more memory G1 has, the better assurance you will get
    that objects are not getting prematurely promoted to the old generation. G1 operates differently
    than previous collectors and is able to handle larger heaps more efficiently.

    If it does not need the memory given to it, it will not use it. The entire engine operates
    differently and does not suffer from too large of heaps, and this is industry-wide accepted
    information that under G1 to keep Xms and Xmx the same!

2.  **UnlockExperimentalVMOptions:** needed for some the below options

3.  **G1NewSizePercent:** These are the important ones. You now can specify percentages of an
    overall desired range for the new generation. With these settings, we tell G1 to not use its
    default 5% for new gen, and instead give it 40%! **Minecraft has an extremely high memory
    allocation rate**, ranging to at least 800MB/second on a 30 player server! And this is
    mostly short-lived objects (Block Position).

    Now, this means Minecraft **really** needs more focus on new gen to be able to even support this
    allocation rate. If your new gen is too small, you will be running new gen collections 1-2+
    times per second, which is awful. You will have so many pauses that TPS has risk of suffering,
    and the server will not be able to keep up with the cost of GCs. Then combine the fact that
    objects will now promote faster, resulting in your old gen growing faster. Given more new gen,
    we are able to slow down the intervals of young gen collections, resulting in more time for
    short-lived objects to die young and overall more efficient GC behavior.

4.  **G1MixedGCLiveThresholdPercent:** Controls when to include regions in mixed GCs in the young
    GC collection, keeping old gen tidy without doing a normal old gen GC collection. When your
    memory is less than this percent, old gen won't even be included in 'mixed' collections. Mixed
    are not as heavy as a full old collection, so having small incremental cleanups of old keeps
    memory usage light.

    Default is 65 to 85 depending on the Java version, we are setting that to 90 to ensure we reclaim garbage
    in old gen as fast as possible to retain as much free regions as we can.

5.  **G1ReservePercent=20:** Minecraft memory allocation rate in up-to-date versions is really insane. We
    run the risk of a dreaded "to-space exhaustion" not having enough memory free to move data
    around. This ensures more memory is waiting to be used for this operation. Default is 10, so we
    are giving another 10 to it.

6.  **MaxTenuringThreshold=1:** Minecraft has a really high allocation rate of memory. Of that
    memory, most is reclaimed in the eden generation. However, transient data will overflow into
    survivor. Initially played with completely removing survivor and had decent results, but does
    result in transient data making its way to old which is not good. Max Tenuring 1 ensures that we
    do not promote transient data to old generation, but anything that survives 2 passes of GC is
    just going to be assumed as longer-lived.

    Doing this greatly reduces pause times in young collections as copying data up to 15 times in
    survivor space for a tenured object really takes a lot of time for actually old memory. Ideally
    the GC engine would track average age for objects instead and tenure out data faster, but that
    is not how it works.

    Considering average GC rate is 10s to the upwards of minutes per young collection, this does not
    result in any 'garbage' being promoted, and just delays longer lived memory to be collected in
    mixed GCs.

7.  **SurvivorRatio=32:** Because we drastically reduced MaxTenuringThreshold, we will be reducing
    use of survivor space drastically. This frees up more regions to be used by eden instead.

8.  **AlwaysPreTouch:** AlwaysPreTouch gets the memory setup and reserved at process start ensuring
    it is contiguous, improving the efficiency of it more. This improves the operating systems
    memory access speed. Mandatory to use Transparent Huge Pages

9.  **+DisableExplicitGC:** Many plugins think they know how to control memory, and try to invoke
    garbage collection. Plugins that do this trigger a full garbage collection, triggering a massive
    lag spike. This flag disables plugins from trying to do this, protecting you from their bad
    code.

10. **MaxGCPauseMillis=200:** This setting controls how much memory is used in between the minimum
    and maximum ranges specified for your new generation. This is a "goal" for how long you want
    your server to pause for collections. 200 is aiming for at most loss of 4 ticks. This will
    result in a short TPS drop, however the server can make up for this drop instantly, meaning it
    will have no meaningful impact on your TPS. 200ms is lower than players can recognize. In
    testing, having this value constrained to an even lower number results in G1 not recollecting
    memory fast enough and potentially running out of old gen triggering a full collection. Just
    because this number is 200 does not mean every collection will be 200. It means it can use up to
    200 if it really needs it, and we need to let it do its job when there is memory to collect.

11. **+ParallelRefProcEnabled:** Optimizes the GC process to use multiple threads for weak reference
    checking. Not sure why this isn't default...

12. **G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5:** Default is 10% of time spent during pause updating RSets,
    reduce this to 5% to make more of it concurrent to reduce pause durations.

13. **G1MixedGCCountTarget=4:** Default is 8. Because we are aiming to collect slower, with less old
    gen usage, try to reclaim old gen memory faster to avoid running out of old.

14. **G1HeapRegionSize=8M+:** Default is auto calculated. Super important for Minecraft, especially
    1.15, as with low memory situations, the default calculation will in most times be too low. Any
    memory allocation half of this size (4MB) will be treated as "Humongous" and promote straight to
    old generation and is harder to free. If you allow Java to use the default, you will be
    destroyed with a significant chunk of your memory getting treated as Humongous.

15. **+PerfDisableSharedMem:** Causes GC to write to file system which can cause major latency if
    disk IO is high - see https://www.evanjones.ca/jvm-mmap-pause.html

### Transparent huge pages

Controversial feature but may be usable if you can not configure your host for real HugeTLBFS. Try
adding `-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages` but it's extremely important you also have `AlwaysPreTouch` set.
Otherwise, THP will likely hurt you. We have not measured how THP works for Minecraft or its impact with
`AlwaysPreTouch`, so this section is for the advanced users who want to experiment.
