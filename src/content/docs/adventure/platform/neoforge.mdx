import Dependency from "/src/components/Dependency.astro";

Adventure supports NeoForge on *Minecraft: Java Edition* 1.21 and up, for both server-side and client-side use. Each major version of Minecraft will usually require
a new release of the platform.

The platform supports all features, including localization and custom renderers.

## Dependency

The NeoForge platform is packaged as a mod, designed to be included in mods via jar-in-jar packaging. As with the rest of the Adventure projects,
releases are distributed on Maven Central, and snapshots on Sonatype OSS:

<Dependency name="neoforge" template="adventure-platform-mod" />

:::danger[Attention]

Each major Minecraft release will require different platform versions. For older Minecraft versions, consult the table
at [Modded (Fabric and NeoForge shared API)](/adventure/platform/modded).

## Basic Use

See [Modded (Fabric and NeoForge shared API)](/adventure/platform/modded) for usage details common between NeoForge and Fabric.

## Server

The logical-server side of the modded platform can be accessed any time a server is available, through a `MinecraftServerAudiences`
instance. By default, translatable components will be rendered with the global translator, but a custom renderer can be passed when initializing the platform.

All `AudienceProvider` interface methods are supported.

To get started with Adventure, set up an audience provider like this:

```java
@Mod("my_mod")
public class MyMod {

    private volatile MinecraftServerAudiences adventure;

    public MinecraftServerAudiences adventure() {
        if (this.adventure == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Tried to access Adventure without a running server!");
        }
        return this.adventure;
    }

    public MyMod() {
        // Register with the server lifecycle callbacks
        // This will ensure any platform data is cleared between game instances
        // This is important on the integrated server, where multiple server instances
        // can exist for one mod initialization.
        NeoForge.EVENT_BUS.addListener((ServerStartingEvent e) ->
            this.adventure = MinecraftServerAudiences.of(e.getServer())
        );
        NeoForge.EVENT_BUS.addListener((ServerStoppedEvent e) ->
            this.adventure = null
        );
    }
}
```

From here, audiences can be acquired for players and any other `CommandSource`. Specialized serializer instances are also available, to allow using
game information in component serialization.

## Commands

The NeoForge platform includes a method to register the `KeyArgumentType` and `ComponentArgumentType`:
  - `AdventureArgumentTypes.register();`

This should be called from the constructor of your `@Mod`-annotated class.
Registering the argument types on the server will require all clients that join to have the argument types
registered as well.

## Client

Special for the modded platform, purely client-side operations are supported. The setup is less involved than it is for the server, since the client is a singleton, and there
is only one subject that can be acted on: the client's player.

This means that for most users the `MinecraftClientAudiences` object can be treated as a singleton. The only exception is users using a custom renderer. This makes using Adventure
audiences fairly simple, as this code example shows:

```java
void doThing() {
  // Get the audience
  final Audience client = MinecraftClientAudiences.of().audience();

  // Do something. This will only work when the player is ingame.
  client.sendMessage(Component.text("meow", NamedTextColor.DARK_PURPLE));
}
```

The full functionality of the `Audience` interface is available, including localization!
