# Item Command Converter

In 1.20.5, Mojang has changed the way items work. When before they stored all their metadata in
unstructured NBT, they now utilize so-called item components.


While Minecraft will automatically update all existing items for you, they don't update commands.
This tool helps you convert old item commands to the new format.
