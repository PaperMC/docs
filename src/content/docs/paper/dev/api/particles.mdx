There are two methods to spawn particles:
- [`World.spawnParticle()`](jd:paper:org.bukkit.World#spawnParticle(org.bukkit.Particle,double,double,double,int)) which spawns the particle for all players and
- [`Player.spawnParticle()`](jd:paper:org.bukkit.entity.Player#spawnParticle(org.bukkit.Particle,double,double,double,int)) which spawns the particle only for the player.

Some particles do not require the additional `extra` and `data` fields. This guide explains how the particles **that do**
use these arguments, behave based on their value.

## Directional particles
This type of particle has an initial velocity when spawned. The velocity can be determined in two different ways, however
both take into account the `extra` argument as speed.

:::note
Effective speed varies between particles.
:::

In the following example 8 flame particles are spawned in a 1x1x1 cube shape randomly, with `someLocation` serving as it's center.
The last argument (extra) is set to 0, so the particles don't move.
```java
someWorld.spawnParticle(Particle.FLAME, someLocation, 8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0);
```

:::caution
Leaving the `extra` parameter unset will default it to `1` (used as particle speed),
likely resulting in unexpected behavior.
:::

### Random direction
Setting the `count` parameter to anything positive will yield a random direction for the velocity. The offset arguments are used as random
spawn offset from the location.

An example of spawning 6 crit particles at a location without offset that will move in a random direction at a slow speed.
```java
someWorld.spawnParticle(Particle.CRIT, someLocation, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0.12);
```

### Specified direction
To specify the velocity's direction, set the `count` argument to `0` and use the offset arguments as the direction vector.

An example of a repeating task spawning campfire smoke that slowly goes "up" (positive Y axis).
```java
Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskTimer(plugin,
  () -> someWorld.spawnParticle(Particle.CAMPFIRE_COSY_SMOKE, someLocation, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0.1),
  0, 4);
```
We could also make the smoke go down if we wanted to:
```java
Bukkit.getScheduler().runTaskTimer(plugin,
  () -> someWorld.spawnParticle(Particle.CAMPFIRE_COSY_SMOKE, someLocation, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0.1),
  0, 4);
```
