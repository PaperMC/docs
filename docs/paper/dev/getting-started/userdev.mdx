# paperweight-userdev

**paperweight** is the name of Paper's custom build tooling. The **paperweight-userdev** Gradle plugin part of that
provides access to internal code (also known as NMS) during development.

:::note

This guide is written using the Gradle Kotlin DSL and assumes you have some basic knowledge of Gradle.
If you want to see a fully-functioning plugin that uses **paperweight-userdev**,
check out this [example plugin](https://github.com/PaperMC/paperweight-test-plugin).

:::

## Why this is useful
The Paper server JARs we provide on the downloads page through the API are **paperclip** JARs. These
use Spigot's mappings, which are essentially some type names, but fully obfuscated fields and methods.
This can make it hard to work with in a development environment. This plugin lets you use fully deobfuscated
types, names, and fields during development, and then remaps your plugin, so it can still be used with the obfuscated
server.

:::caution[1.20.5]

As of Minecraft version 1.20.5, Paper ships with a Mojang-mapped runtime instead of reobfuscating the server to Spigot mappings as we have traditionally done since Paper 1.17.
See [here](#1205) for more details.
:::

:::caution

The re-obfuscation does not apply to reflection. Look at something like [this library](https://github.com/jpenilla/reflection-remapper) to be able to
use non-obfuscated names in reflection.

:::

## Adding the plugin
Add the plugin to your `build.gradle.kts` file.
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.papermc.paperweight.userdev") version "1.7.0" // Check for new versions at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.papermc.paperweight.userdev
}
```

The latest version of `paperweight-userdev` supports dev bundles for Minecraft 1.17.1 and newer, so it's best practice to keep it up to date!
Only the latest version of `paperweight-userdev` is officially supported, and we will ask you to update first if you are having problems with old versions.

:::info[Snapshots]

**paperweight-userdev** releases are available through the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.papermc.paperweight.userdev), but if you
want to use SNAPSHOT versions, you must add Paper's Maven repository to `settings.gradle.kts` with:
```kotlin
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
    }
}
```

:::

## Adding the dev bundle dependency
If you try to load your Gradle project now, you will receive an error saying you have to declare
a dev bundle dependency. You can do that by adding to your `dependencies` block in your `build.gradle.kts`
file.

<VersionFormattedCode language={"kotlin"}>
```
dependencies {
    // Other Dependencies
    paperweight.paperDevBundle("%%_MAJ_MIN_MC_%%-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
</VersionFormattedCode>

:::tip

You should remove any dependency on the Paper API, as the dev bundle includes that.

:::

## Gradle tasks

### `reobfJar`

This task creates a plugin JAR that is re-obfuscated to Spigot's runtime mappings.
This means it will work on standard Paper servers.

The output will be inside the `build/libs` folder. The JAR whose filename includes `-dev`
is Mojang-mapped (not re-obfuscated) and will not work on most servers.

:::info[Shadow]

If you have the shadow Gradle plugin applied in your build script, **paperweight-userdev** will
detect that and use the shaded JAR as the input for the `reobfJar` task.

The `-dev-all.jar` file in `build/libs` is the shaded, but not re-obfuscated JAR.

:::

You can make the `reobfJar` task run on the default `build` task with:
```kotlin
tasks.assemble {
    dependsOn(reobfJar)
}
```

## 1.20.5
As of 1.20.5, Paper ships with a Mojang-mapped runtime instead of reobfuscating the server to Spigot mappings as we have traditionally done since Paper 1.17.
Additionally, CraftBukkit classes will no longer be relocated into a versioned package.
This requires plugins to be deobfuscated before loading when necessary.

Most of this process is done automatically by paperweight but there are some important things to know when using NMS from now on.

### Default mappings assumption
* By default, all Spigot/Bukkit plugins will be assumed to be Spigot-mapped if they do not specify their mappings namespace in the manifest. Conversely, all Paper plugins will be assumed to be Mojang-mapped if they do not specify their mappings namespace in the manifest.
* Spigot-mapped plugins will need to be deobfuscated on first load, Mojang-mapped plugins will not.

### Mojang mappings
If you want to map your plugin with Mojang mappings, you need to add the following code to your build script:

:::note

You only have to change this setting if you are using Bukkit/Spigot plugins. Paper plugins are already assumed to be Mojang-mapped.

:::

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
paperweight.reobfArtifactConfiguration = io.papermc.paperweight.userdev.ReobfArtifactConfiguration.MOJANG_PRODUCTION
```

Additionally, you need to remove all `dependsOn(reobfJar)` lines.

### Spigot mappings
If you are using Paper plugins but want to explicitly use Spigot mappings, you need to change the property to:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
paperweight.reobfArtifactConfiguration = io.papermc.paperweight.userdev.ReobfArtifactConfiguration.REOBF_PRODUCTION
```
