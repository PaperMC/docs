# Paper Per World Configuration

Configuration options in `paper-world-defaults.yml` are configurable on a per-world basis. For more
information, see the [Configuration Guide](../how-to/configuration.md) For global configuration, see
the [Paper Global Configuration Reference](global-configuration.md)

## anticheat

### anti-xray

:::tip

Recommended configuration for both `engine-mode` `1` and `2` can be found in the
[Configuring Anti-Xray](../how-to/anti-xray.mdx) guide.

:::

#### enabled

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Controls the on/off state for the Anti-Xray system.

#### engine-mode

- **default**: `1`
- **description**: Sets the Anti-Xray engine mode. `1` replaces specified blocks (`hidden-blocks`)
  with other "fake" blocks, `stone` (`deepslate` at y < 0), `netherrack`, or `end_stone` based on
  the dimension. In contrast, `2` will replace both `hidden-blocks` and `replacement-blocks` with
  randomly generated `hidden-blocks`.

#### max-block-height

- **default**: `64`
- **description**: Sets the maximum height (`y` coordinate, starting from the bottom of the world)
  to which anti-xray will operate. Only integer multiples of 16 are accepted. All other values will
  be rounded down. The [Minecraft Wiki page about Ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore) may be
  helpful in determining the best value for you.

#### update-radius

- **default**: `2`
- **description**: Radius for block updates which will be sent containing real block data when the
  client interacts with a block. Only values `0`, `1`, and `2` are accepted. Values smaller than `0`
  will be rounded up to `0`, while values larger than `2` will be rounded down to `2`. `0` is only
  designed for testing purposes. Do not use it in production.

#### lava-obscures

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Whether to obfuscate blocks touching lava. Does not work well with non-stone-like
  ore textures. This is because lava, while being mostly opaque, does not cover blocks fully at the
  surface.

#### use-permission

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Whether to allow players with the `paper.antixray.bypass` permission to bypass
  anti-xray. Checking this permission is disabled by default as legacy permission plugins may
  struggle with the number of checks made. This should only be used with modern permission plugins.

#### hidden-blocks

- **default**:
  `[copper_ore, deepslate_copper_ore, gold_ore, deepslate_gold_ore, iron_ore, deepslate_iron_ore, coal_ore, deepslate_coal_ore, lapis_ore, deepslate_lapis_ore, mossy_cobblestone, obsidian, chest, diamond_ore, deepslate_diamond_ore, redstone_ore, deepslate_redstone_ore, clay, emerald_ore, deepslate_emerald_ore, ender_chest]`
- **description**: With `engine-mode: 1`, these blocks will be replaced by `stone` (`deepslate` at y < 0), `netherrack`, or `end_stone`, based on the dimension. All types of air are ignored on this list.

  With `engine-mode: 2`, these blocks will be randomly placed in the world, replacing both
  `hidden-blocks` and `replacement-blocks`. Tile entities, such as chests or spawners, are not
  allowed on this list. Individual blocks may be added multiple times, increasing their chance of
  being placed. The default block states are placed.

#### replacement-blocks:

- **default**: [stone, oak_planks, deepslate]
- **description**: With `engine-mode: 1`, replacement blocks are not used. Changing this list will
  have no effect.

  With `engine-mode: 2`, both `replacement-blocks` and `hidden-blocks` are randomly replaced by
  `hidden-blocks.` While tile entities are ignored in the `hidden-blocks` list, they may be added to
  the `replacement-blocks` list. All types of air blocks are ignored here.

### obfuscation

#### items

##### hide-durability

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Controls whether durability information is sent to other players' clients. This
  may break resource packs that rely on durability values when observing other players.

##### hide-itemmeta

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Controls whether unnecessary item information (such as enchantments, items in a
  shulker box/bundle, etc.) that can give cheat clients an advantage should be sent to other
  players' clients. This may break resource packs that rely on information such as enchantments,
  lore or item names when observing other players.
  
##### hide-itemmeta-with-visual-effects

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Controls whether item information that affects how an item is displayed
  (such as lodestone compass positions) should be sent to other players' clients. This information
  could be used by cheat clients to give another advantage to the cheating player. However, this
  will affect how certain items look when held by another player.

## chunks

### auto-save-interval

- **default**: `-1`
- **description**: Configures the world saving interval in ticks. Overrides `ticks-per.autosave` in
  `bukkit.yml` for this world. A value of `-1` will use the global `ticks-per.autosave` in
  `bukkit.yml`.

### delay-chunk-unloads-by

- **default**: `10s`
- **description**: Delays chunk unloads by the specified time.

### entity-per-chunk-save-limit

- **default**: `{experience_orb: -1...}`
- **description**: Limits the number of any type of entity that will be saved/loaded per chunk. A
  value of `-1` disables the limit for a specific entity. Any entity may be added to the list,
  beyond the enumerated defaults.

### fixed-chunk-inhabited-time

- **default**: `-1`
- **description**: If `0` or greater, set the chunk inhabited time to a fixed number. Fixed in this
  instance means static or unchanging. This is **not** fixing a bug. The timer is increased when
  chunks are kept loaded because of player activity.

### max-auto-save-chunks-per-tick

- **default**: `24`
- **description**: The maximum number of chunks the auto-save system will save in a single tick.

### prevent-moving-into-unloaded-chunks

### max-entity-collisions

- **default**: `8`
- **description**: Instructs the server to stop processing collisions after this value is reached.

### only-players-collide

  of other entities.

### behavior

#### baby-zombie-movement-modifier

- **default**: `0.5`
- **description**: Modifies the speed that baby zombies move at, where `0.5` is 50% faster than the

- **default**: `-1`
- **description**: Instructs the server to put a maximum value on experience orbs, preventing them
  all from merging down into 1 single orb. A value of `-1` instructs the server to use no max value,
  allowing them to merge down into a single orb. This is especially noticeable when defeating boss
  monsters.

#### mobs-can-always-pick-up-loot

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Controls whether zombies or skeletons (each configurable individually) will
  always be able to pick up loot. If set to false, the probability that a zombie picks up items
  depends on the world's difficulty (vanilla behavior).

#### nerf-pigmen-from-nether-portals

- **description**: Determines if items will have different despawn rates.

##### items

- **default**: `{ cobblestone: 300 }` (a list of item to ticks mappings)

  This can be one of the following values:
  - **`saferegen`**: Regenerate a UUID for the entity, or delete it if they are close.
  - **`delete`**: Delete the entity.
  - **`silent`**: Does nothing, not printing logs.
  - **`warn`**: Does nothing, printing logs.

##### safe-regen-delete-range

  will delete all but 1 of them.

#### filter-bad-tile-entity-nbt-from-falling-blocks

- **default**: `true`
- **description**: Instructs the server to remove certain NBT data from falling blocks.

  that is used for all arrows.

#### per-player-mob-spawns

- **default**: `true`
- **description**: Determines whether the mob limit (in bukkit.yml) is counted per player or for the
  entire server. Enabling this setting results in roughly the same number of mobs, but with a more

  below allow configuring the default behavior of maps obtained in different ways.

##### loot-tables

- **default**: `default`
- **description**: Overrides the loot table-configured check for undiscovered structures. `default`
  allows loot tables to individually determine if the map should allow discovered locations in its

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Instructs the server to keep Primed TNT entities from moving in flowing water.

### split-overstacked-loot

  improves hopper performance but will break protection plugins and any others that depend on this
  event.

### ignore-occluding-blocks

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Determines if hoppers will ignore containers inside occluding blocks, like a
  hopper minecart inside a sand block. Enabling this will improve performance for hoppers checking

### shield-blocking-delay

- **default**: `5`
- **description**: The number of ticks between a player activating their shield and it actually
  blocking damage.

### show-sign-click-command-failure-msgs-to-player

### update-pathfinding-on-block-update

- **default**: `true`
- **description**: Controls whether the pathfinding of mobs is updated when a block is updated in
  the world. Disabling this option can improve the server performance significantly, while there is
  almost no noticeable effect on the game mechanics. This is recommended when there are lots of
  entities loaded, and you have automated farms or redstone clocks.

## scoreboards

### allow-non-player-entities-on-scoreboards

- **default**: `true`
- **description**: Instructs the server to always treat non-player entities as if they are never on a
  team. Disabling this may slightly decrease the amount of time the server
  spends calculating entity collisions.

### use-vanilla-world-scoreboard-name-coloring

- **default**: `false`
- **description**: Instructs the server to use the vanilla scoreboard for player nickname coloring.
  Useful when playing on adventure maps made for the vanilla server and client.

- **description**: Allows players to use signs while inside spawn protection.

### keep-spawn-loaded

- **default**: `true`
- **description**: Instructs the server to keep the spawn chunks loaded at all times.

### keep-spawn-loaded-range

- **default**: `10`
- **description**: The range in chunks around spawn to keep loaded.
