# Configuring Velocity

Velocity is designed to be easy to configure and set up. Every Velocity file is stored in
`velocity.toml`, located in the directory where you started the proxy. Velocity uses the
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) file format, as it is easy to understand and avoids
pitfalls of YAML and other configuration formats common in the community.

An up-to-date version of the default configuration can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PaperMC/Velocity/blob/dev/3.0.0/proxy/src/main/resources/default-velocity.toml).

## Data types

There are a few "special" data types in the Velocity configuration.

### Chat

Chat messages may be provided in [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) format.

RGB support is available for Minecraft 1.16 and later versions.

### Address

An address is a pairing of an IP address or hostname, and a port, separated by a colon (`:`). For
instance, `127.0.0.1:25577` and `server01.example.com:25565` are valid addresses.

## Root section

These settings mostly cover the basic, most essential settings of the proxy.

|------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config-version`                   | String  | This is the current config version used by Velocity. You should not alter this setting.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `bind`                             | Address | This tells the proxy to accept connections on a specific IP. By default, Velocity will listen for connections on all IP addresses on the computer on port 25577.                                                                                                   |
| `motd`                             | Chat    | This allows you to change the message shown to players when they add your server to their server list. You can use [MiniMessage format](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html).                                                                          |
| `show-max-players`                 | Integer | This allows you to customize the number of "maximum" players in the player's server list. Note that Velocity doesn't have a maximum number of players it supports.                                                                                                 |
| `online-mode`                      | Boolean | Should we authenticate players with Mojang? By default, this is on.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `force-key-authentication`         | Boolean | Should the proxy enforce the new public key security standard? By default, this is on.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `player-info-forwarding-mode`      | Enum    | See [Configuring player information forwarding](../getting-started/forwarding.md) for more information.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `prevent-client-proxy-connections` | Boolean | If client's ISP/AS sent from this proxy is different from the one from Mojang's authentication server, the player is kicked. This disallows some VPN and proxy connections but is a weak form of protection.                                                       |
| `forwarding-secret-file`           | String  | The name of the file in which the forwarding secret is stored. This secret is used to ensure that player info forwarded by Velocity comes from your proxy and not from someone pretending to run Velocity. See the "Player info forwarding" section for more info. |
| `announce-forge`                   | Boolean | This setting determines whether Velocity should present itself as a Forge/FML-compatible server. By default, this is disabled.                                                                                                                                     |
| `kick-existing-players`            | Boolean | Allows restoring the Vanilla behavior of kicking users on the proxy if they try to reconnect (e.g. lost internet connection briefly).                                                                                                                              |
| `ping-passthrough`                 | String  | Allows forwarding nothing (the default), the `MODS` (for Forge), the `DESCRIPTION`, or everything (`ALL`) from the `try` list (or forced host server connection order).                                                                                            |
| `enable-player-address-logging`    | Boolean | If disabled (default is true), player IP addresses will be replaced by `<ip address withheld>` in logs.                                                                                                                                                            |

## `servers` section

|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A server name | Address | This makes the proxy aware of a server that it can connect to.                                                             |
| `try`         | Array   | This specifies what servers Velocity should try to connect to upon player login and when a player is kicked from a server. |

## `forced-hosts` section

| Setting Name | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A host name  | Hostname | This configures the proxy to create a forced host for the specified hostname. An array of servers to try for the specified hostname is the value. |

| `compression-threshold`                    | Integer | This is the minimum size (in bytes) that a packet must be before the proxy compresses it. Minecraft uses 256 bytes by default.                                                                          |
| `compression-level`                        | Integer | This setting indicates what `zlib` compression level the proxy should use to compress packets. The default value uses the default zlib level.                                                           |
| `login-ratelimit`                          | Integer | This setting determines the minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) that must pass before a connection from the same IP address will be accepted by the proxy. A value of `0` disables the rate limit. |
| `connection-timeout`                       | Integer | This setting determines how long the proxy will wait to connect to a server before timing out.                                                                                                          |
| `read-timeout`                             | Integer | This setting determines how long the proxy will wait to receive data from the server before timing out.                                                                                                 |
| `haproxy-protocol`                         | Boolean | This setting determines whether or not Velocity should receive HAProxy PROXY messages. If you don't use HAProxy, leave this setting off.                                                                |
| `tcp-fast-open`                            | Boolean | This setting allows you to enable TCP Fast Open support in Velocity. Your proxy must run on Linux kernel >=4.14 for this setting to apply.                                                              |
| `bungee-plugin-message-channel`            | Boolean | This setting allows you to enable or disable support for the BungeeCord plugin messaging channel.                                                                                                       |
| `show-ping-requests`                       | Boolean | This setting allows you to log ping requests sent by clients to the proxy.                                                                                                                              |
| `announce-proxy-commands`                  | Boolean | This setting allows you to enable or disable explicitly sending proxy commands to the client (for Minecraft 1.13+ tab completion).                                                                      |
| `failover-on-unexpected-server-disconnect` | Boolean | This setting allows you to determine if the proxy should failover or disconnect the user in the event of an unclean disconnect.                                                                         |
| `log-command-executions`                   | Boolean | Determines whether or not the proxy should log all commands run by the user.                                                                                                                            |
| `log-player-connections`                   | Boolean | Enables logging of player connections when connecting to the proxy, switching servers and disconnecting from the proxy.                                                                                 |
| `accepts-transfers`                        | Boolean | Determines whether or not the proxy accepts incoming transfers from other servers. If disabled, the proxy will disconnect transferred clients.                                                          |

|----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`      | Boolean | Whether or not Velocity should reply to Minecraft query protocol requests. You can usually leave this false. |
| `port`         | Number  | Specifies which port that Velocity should listen on for GameSpy 4 (Minecraft query protocol) requests.       |
| `map`          | String  | Specifies the map name to be shown to clients.                                                               |
