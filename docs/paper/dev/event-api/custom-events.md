# Custom Events

Creating custom events is a great way to add functionality to your plugin. 
This will allow for other people to listen for your custom events and add functionality to your plugin.

## Creating a custom event

To create a custom event, you need to create a class that extends `Event`. Each event has a `HandlerList` that contains all the listeners that are listening for that event.

This list is used to call the listeners when the event is called.

:::info `getHandlerList`

Although it is not inherited from `Event`, you need to add a static `getHandlerList()` method and return the `HandlerList` for your event.
Both methods are required for your event to work.

:::

```java title="PaperIsCoolEvent.java"
public class PaperIsCoolEvent extends Event {

    private static final HandlerList HANDLER_LIST = new HandlerList();

    public static HandlerList getHandlerList() {
        return HANDLER_LIST;
    }

    @Override
    public HandlerList getHandlers() {
        return HANDLER_LIST;
    }
}
```

Now that we have created our event, we can add some functionality to it. 
Perhaps this will contain a message that will be broadcast to the server when the event is called.

```java title="PaperIsCoolEvent.java"
public class PaperIsCoolEvent extends Event {

    private static final HandlerList HANDLER_LIST = new HandlerList();
    private Component message;

    public PaperIsCoolEvent(Component message) {
        this.message = message;
    }

    public static HandlerList getHandlerList() {
        return HANDLER_LIST;
    }

    @Override
    public HandlerList getHandlers() {
        return HANDLER_LIST;
    }

    public Component getMessage() {
        return this.message;
    }
    
    public void setMessage(Component message) {
        this.message = message;
    }
}
```

## Calling the event

Now that we have created our event, we can call it.

```java title="ExamplePlugin.java"
public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    // ...

    public void callCoolPaperEvent() {
        PaperIsCoolEvent coolEvent = new PaperIsCoolEvent(Component.text("Paper is cool!"))
        coolEvent.callEvent();
        // Plugins could have changed the message from inside their listeners here. So we need to get the message again.
        // This event structure allows for other plugins to change the message to their taste. 
        // Like, for example, a plugin that adds a prefix to all messages.
        Bukkit.broadcast(coolEvent.getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Implementing cancellation

If you want to allow your event to be cancelled, you can implement the `Cancellable` interface.

```java title="PaperIsCoolEvent.java"
public class PaperIsCoolEvent extends Event implements Cancellable {

    private static final HandlerList HANDLER_LIST = new HandlerList();
    private Component message;
    private boolean cancelled;

    // ...

    @Override
    public boolean isCancelled() {
        return this.cancelled;
    }

    @Override
    public void setCancelled(boolean cancelled) {
        this.cancelled = cancelled;
    }
}
```

Now, when the event is called, you can check if it is cancelled and act accordingly.

```java title="ExamplePlugin.java"
public class ExamplePlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    // ...

    public void callCoolPaperEvent() {
        PaperIsCoolEvent coolEvent = new PaperIsCoolEvent(Component.text("Paper is cool!"))
        coolEvent.callEvent();
        if (!coolEvent.isCancelled()) {
            Bukkit.broadcast(coolEvent.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```
