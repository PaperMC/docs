## Server Setup and Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Create a dedicated directory for your server
2. Place the downloaded Paper JAR file in this directory
3. Create a startup script or use our [Startup Script Generator](/misc/tools/start-script-gen)

### Running the Server

#### Using the Startup Script Generator
Visit our [Startup Script Generator](/misc/tools/start-script-gen) to create an optimized startup script for your system.

#### Manual Command
For a basic startup command:
```bash
java -Xms4G -Xmx4G -jar paper.jar --nogui
```

:::note[Command Explanation]
- `-Xms4G`: Initial RAM allocation (4GB)
- `-Xmx4G`: Maximum RAM allocation (4GB)
- `--nogui`: Disables the vanilla server GUI for better performance
- Adjust RAM values based on your server's needs and available system resources
:::

### First-Time Setup
1. Run the server for the first time to generate necessary files
2. Accept the EULA by editing `eula.txt` and setting `eula=true`
3. Restart the server to complete initialization

## Server Configuration

After initial setup, you'll want to configure your server:

1. Review and modify `server.properties` for basic server settings
2. Configure Paper-specific settings in `paper.yml`
3. Set up world-specific configurations in `bukkit.yml` and `spigot.yml`
4. For detailed configuration guides, see:
   - [Global Configuration](/paper/reference/global-configuration)
   - [Per World Configuration](/paper/reference/world-configuration)

## Updating Your Server

Paper makes updating simple and safe:
1. Download the new version from the downloads page
2. Replace the old JAR file with the new one
3. Restart your server

For detailed update instructions, see our [Update Tutorial](/paper/updating).

## Migration Guide

### From Vanilla
Paper automatically handles the conversion of vanilla world saves, including:
- Separation of dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End)
- Conversion of world data to Paper's optimized format
- Preservation of all existing world data

### From CraftBukkit/Spigot
Paper is a direct drop-in replacement:
- No world conversion needed
- All plugins and configurations remain compatible
- Improved performance out of the box

## Next Steps

To optimize your server and unlock Paper's full potential:
1. Review our [Next Steps Guide](/paper/next-steps)
2. Configure performance optimizations
3. Set up essential plugins
4. Implement proper backup solutions
5. Configure security settings

:::tip[Pro Tip]
