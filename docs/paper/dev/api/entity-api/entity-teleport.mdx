# Teleportation

Entities can be instantaneously teleported to specific positions, synchronously and asynchronously with the
<Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Entity#teleport(org.bukkit.Location)"}>`teleport`</Javadoc> and
<Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Entity#teleportAsync(org.bukkit.Location)"}>`teleportAsync`</Javadoc> API.

:::tip[Performance]

If you expect to teleport into unloaded chunks, it is recommended to use the `teleportAsync` API,
as it avoids doing synchronous chunk loads, which put a lot of stress on the server's main thread -
hurting overall performance.

:::

```java
entity.teleport(location); // loads chunks synchronously and teleports the entity

entity.teleportAsync(location).thenAccept(success -> { // loads chunks asynchronously and teleports the entity
    // this code is ran when the teleport completes
    // the Future is completed on the main thread, so it is safe to use the API here

    if (success) {
        // the entity was teleported successfully!
    }
});
```

:::danger

You should **NEVER** call `.get()`/`.join()` on the `teleportAsync` `Future` on the main thread,
as it **WILL** deadlock your server, if the chunk you're teleporting into is not loaded.

:::

## Look at

The <Javadoc name={"org.bukkit.entity.Player#lookAt(io.papermc.paper.math.Position,io.papermc.paper.entity.LookAnchor)"}>`lookAt`</Javadoc>
API allows you to make a player look at a certain position or entity.

```java
player.lookAt(
    position,
    LookAnchor.EYES // the player's eyes will be facing the position
);

player.lookAt(
    entity,
    LookAnchor.EYES // the player's eyes will be facing the entity
    LookAnchor.FEET // the player will be facing the entity's feet
);
```

## Teleport flags

Teleport flags offer a way to teleport entities whilst being able to customize behavior.
This allows you to do things like teleport players using relative flags and being able to retain passengers.

All available teleport flags can be found in the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.entity.TeleportFlag"}>`TeleportFlag`</Javadoc> class.

### Relative teleportation

Teleport a player relatively, preventing velocity from being reset in the X, Y and Z axes.

```java
player.teleport(
    location,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.X,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.Y,
    TeleportFlag.Relative.Z
);
```

### Retaining passengers

Teleport an entity with the <Javadoc name={"io.papermc.paper.entity.TeleportFlag$EntityState#RETAIN_PASSENGERS"}>`RETAIN_PASSENGERS`</Javadoc> flag,
allowing its passengers to be transferred with the entity.

```java
entity.teleport(location, TeleportFlag.EntityState.RETAIN_PASSENGERS);
```
